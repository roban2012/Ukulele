10 Things I Wish I’d Known About Ukuleles (Before I Bought One)<br><br>
 

Jemsite has been doing a series called 10 Things I Wish I’d Known About Guitars (Before I Bought One) and I know a good idea when I steal one. The concept: if you could hop into your DeLorean, whack it up to 88 mph and visit yourself when you were buying your first instrument, what advice would you give?<br><br>

In about 50 years’ time I imagine myself sitting in a comfy chair and my grandkids scurrying up to me in their space-pyjamas and asking, “Granddad, what was life like before the internet?” And I’ll say, “Put down your hoverboards, jump up on my knee and I’ll tell you.” Then I’ll twirl my mustachios wistfully and reply, “It was FUCKIN’ AWFUL!”<br><br>

Back when I got my first ukulele C during my teenage guitar obsession C there were no internets, YouTubes or blogs to teach a boy anything. I didn’t know anyone who played ukulele. I’d heard George Formby and one other song with a ukulele once. I didn’t have a clue. As a result, it took me many years to see the potential of the uke. So here’s what I’d tell the fat, ugly, stupid, teenage me as he wandered into Bakewell Music Shop to buy a ukulele.<br><br>

1. The strings don’t go fattest to thinnest.<br><br>

Just to prove how ignorant I was, I actually tried restringing it the ‘right’ way. It didn’t occur to me that the people who made it might have had a better idea of how to string it than I did. I did have a book. But it was a very slim, old one. I either didn’t read it or it failed to mention this fairly important detail.<br><br>

2. Good ukuleles exist. Your local music shop doesn’t have one.<br><br>

Bakewell is famous for it’s tarts (and they are exceeding good). It’s not famous as a centre of outstanding luthiery. The uke I bought was complete junk. I didn’t even know there were better ukes. I think this is the main reason I rarely played the uke for many years. <br><br>

Message to me: buy a Martin ukulele or six. They might seem expensive now but you ain’t seen nothing yet.<br><br>

3. Good ukulele strings exist. Your local music shop doesn’t have them.<br><br>

The same goes for the strings. In fact, I don’t remember them selling strings at all. I don’t know where I would have been able buy good strings. God, I love you, internet. I’m going to miss you come the post-apocalyptic Mad-Max world. 
<br><br>
4. Tighten the screws. It might stay in tune.<br><br>

I think I did eventually work this one out myself. But only many months after giving up on ever getting it to stay in tune.
<br><br>
5. Ukuleles are not little guitars.<br><br>

I started figuring this one out pretty quickly. After trying to strum it with a plectrum for 3 minutes I realised that clearly wasn’t the way to go. It took me much longer to figure out that the high-G string could be a help rather than a hindrance (partly because it took me a while to figure out it was a high-G string).<br><br>

6. Eventually, you won’t want to play the guitar any more.<br><br>

Actually, I might gloss over this fact lest it puts me off picking it up in the first place.
<br><br>
7. Fewer strings means harder, not easier.<br><br>

Not entirely true, I know. But it is more of challenge to play difficult pieces on the uke. And more rewarding.
<br><br>
8. Don’t steal plutonium from the Libyans.<br><br>

9. In about 15 years time ukuleles are going to be the coolest thing in the world and you’re going to be writing about them every day. You should practice more.<br><br>

There’s no getting round the fact I’m a mediocre player. It might be the fact that I’m not naturally musically talented. But more practice certainly couldn’t harm.<br><br>

10. You like her. She likes you. Just ask her out you useless, spotty idiot. And sell your sister to organ harvesters and put the money into Google and Microsoft.<br><br>

No, it’s nothing to do with ukuleles. But if I’m time traveling here, I’m not going to spend all ten on ukuleles.

Top 10 Tips<br><br>
There are quite a few of these “Top 10 Tips” out there on the internets. I’ll try to add something to that with my own personal Top 10 Tips for beginning ukulele players. When I bought my first ukulele I was completely unprepared, but I had the advantage of having some guitar background though. I’ll try to give you some really useful tips that will give you a jump start when you begin playing the ukulele. Make sure to also check out the before buying an ukulele guide and ukulele buying guide.<br><br>

1. Get a decent ukulele.<br><br>

This is the most important one of all when you are serious about wanting to learn how to play the ukulele. There are a few good ukuleles in the $100 range, but you can almost be sure that an ukulele under $50 is not that good. The main issue you will have is that it won’t be able to stay in tune. I speak from experience. I’ve bought a $45 “Harley Benton” soprano once and it couldn’t keep the E string in tune for even one strum. So be warned! Check out the “ukulele buying guide” to get the right ukulele for you and if you have the chance, try some ukuleles in your local music shop.
<br><br>
2. Learn how to hold your ukulele.<br><br>

This may sound stupid but it can help you a lot in the future! Take a few minutes and try some positions either sitting and standing. When you are sitting, you can let the body of the ukulele rest on one of your legs and rest your strumming arm on the top of the ukulele. That way the ukulele neck should “float” in the air. When you are standing you can hold it against your chest and keep it there with your strumming arm. All this may take some practice but it will pay of in the end because that way you will be able to pick up your ukulele and play (even when walking around), without messing around first. In my opinion a strap is unnecessary and it just adds bulk to the ukulele. I had some trouble at the beginning, but nowadays I’m walking around the house, in the garden,… with my ukulele. Small note: don’t hold it too tight! The sound still needs to vibrate properly through the body.<br><br>

3. Have fun!<br><br>

The ukulele is a fun instrument. Some may call the ukulele a toy, so what, toys are fun to play with! But it really isn’t a toy at all, it’s a true instrument and you can do wonderful things with it. Also don’t make the mistake by thinking that it is an easy instrument, you will need to practice a lot to master it, but even when you only know the basics it is already so much fun! Enjoy playing it and without knowing, you will improve each and every day.
<br><br>
4. First things first, the basics.<br><br>

When looking on YouTube and other websites you will quickly learn that amazing things can be done with the ukulele, but like every skill in life you’ll need to learn the basics first. Don’t try to play some big fancy tab when you are just starting out, learn your chords instead. Start with the majors, minors and then go on with other chords. The UkuChords chords chart is perfect for this, since it gives you a very decent overview of all the major chords. You will notice that once you know your chords you will be playing tons of songs without even thinking twice on how to play them. (Also check out the UkuChords Chord Library).<br><br>

5. Decent strumming makes all the difference.<br><br>

At the start you’ll probably only be doing simple up and down, up and down, up and down. But after a while you can try to add some slapping and palm muting to really get that chunky, funky and groovy feeling. I won’t explain how to strum in here, feel free to take a look at The Ultimate Strumming guide. Wondering why there aren’t any strumming patterns posted along with songs? Well, that’s a whole other story. This isn’t allowed by the MPA (Music Publishers Association) because of copyright issues. They say that it isn’t allowed to share online how to literally play a song. So strumming patterns (rhythm and tempo) aren’t allowed to be shared at all and I’m afraid that there isn’t much I can do about that. It will really help a lot if you try to figure out the strumming yourself. You will learn playing the ukulele a lot quicker and after a while you’ll come up with your own strumming patterns! Carefully listen to the song and “feel” the rhythm. I know that this isn’t easy, but once you get the basics, it’ll go real quick.<br><br>

6. Use UkuTabs.com to learn songs.<br><br>

Hah, this may sound silly but this is actually one of the best ways to learn new songs, since each song on UkuTabs has the chord diagrams for each chord in that song. That way you won’t have to look up the chord diagrams. Also, when you hover over a chord in the song itself, the chord diagram will pop up!<br><br>

7. Play as slowly as you can.
<br><br>
When you know your basic chords and can do some basic strumming you can eventually start to change between chords. Practice this a lot and with many different chords and at first do it as slow as you can so that you can’t possibly make a mistake. Remember that the most important thing is to be accurate instead of being quick! The same goes for when you are starting out with tablatures. Make sure to get a clean sound with no buzzing and muting. Start with slow and easy songs that have easy chords and not that much chord changes. Gradually speed up and try more difficult songs.
<br><br>
 8. Play along and listen to ukulele players.<br><br>

Already in a band? Perfect! Bring along your ukulele and jam along with your friends. Not in a band yet? No problem either, convince your friends to start playing the ukulele! And if that doesn’t work, start your computer, go online and watch ukulele videos where you can play along. Or marvel at the true ukulele guru’s out there! All of this will help you to feel the ukulele “groove” and feel. Listen and watch carefully for tempo’s and rhythm and without knowing, you’ll be learning how to play the ukulele!<br><br>


9. Record yourself playing and listen back to it.<br><br>

I’ve got this tip from the UkuleleHunt (maintained by Alistair Wood). It’s difficult to play and listen to yourself at the same time. Quite often just noticing what you’re doing wrong is enough to fix the problem. It also gets you used to playing infront of the mic C making it less of a big deal when you want to record yourself properly.
<br><br>
 10. Fingering exercises!<br><br>

This might seem a lot. Besides learning chord shapes, learning how to strum, learn how to quickly change chords, etc… you’ll also need to do some fingering exercises. This will help to gradually build up calluses (= toughened area of skin which has become relatively thick and hard in response to repeated friction or pressure). This may sound weird, but this will help a lot in the end, because what you will learn quickly, is that when you start playing stringed instruments your fingers will hurt! Not as much with nylon than with steel stringed instruments though. With the (developing) calluses you’ll notice that will hurt less. I have found the below exercise by Faye Hicks to be a real good one.
<br><br>

Pluck the first string open, then with your index finger on (actually just behind) the first fret, then with your middle finger on the second fret, then with your ring finger on the third fret and finally with your pinky finger on the fourth fret. Do the pinky one twice and then work your way back down: ring finger on third fret, middle finger on second fret, index finger on the first fret, then open. Now move to the second string and repeat the pattern. Then the third string, then the fourth. Run through that a few times at the beginning of each practice. Not only will it toughen up your fingertips, it will limber up your fingers. You can also use this exercise to limber up your right hand too C by practicing different finger picking exercises as you do it. The second thing I found that helped in the early stages of toughening up the fingertips was to play for a short amount of time (e.g. 10 to 15 minutes) several times a days, instead of playing for one long (60 to 90 minute) session.<br><br>

You need to play at least 10-15 min every day to build up those calluses. So even if you only have time to run through those exercises a few times, do it! Your fingers will thank you later on.
<br><br>
xx. One final tip<br><br>

Especially for the female ukulele players out there: cut your fretting hand’s fingernails REALLY short! This is a necessity to get a clean sound since you need to press the strings with the very tips of your fingers.

Ten Tips for Ukulele Beginners<br><br>
 

A couple of weeks ago Mike asked me for one or two tips for ukulele beginners. My brain went whiring into action (actually, is was more a nasty screetching and cracking of gears). I ended up with a big list of stuff. So here, in their original, un-rewritten and bloated form, are all of them.<br><br>

1. Record yourself playing and listen back to it. It’s difficult to play and listen to yourself at the same time. Quite often just noticing what you’re doing wrong is enough to fix the problem. It also gets you used to playing infront of the mic C making it less of a big deal when you want to record yourself properly.
<br><br>
2. Much to the RIAA’s disgust, you can’t sue someone for stealing a chord progression. Although Metallica tried to sue the band Unfaith for changing from F to E. If you hear something you like, work it out and steal it.
<br><br>
3. Practice so slowly you can’t possibly make a mistake. If you make the same mistake over and over again, it’s incredibly hard to get rid of it. It’s much easier to start slow, get the tune under your fingers and gradually speed up. If you’re more consciencious than me, you’ll use a metronome while you’re doing this sort of thing.
<br><br>
4. Learn how to read ukulele tab. There are plenty of people around who can play the ukulele without learning to read tab. But there’s so much ukulele tab around on the net now that it’s really going to increase the speed that you can pick up new tunes.<br><br>

5. Once you’ve decided you enjoy the ukulele, get a nice one. Almost everyone starts of playing on a very cheap ukulele. These ukes are fine for deciding if playing the ukulele is for you. But once you’re into it, get yourself a decent quality ukulele. It’ll be easier to play, sound better (so you’ll be more pleased with the way you sound), and will give you more impetus to practice.<br><br>

6. The type of strings you use can make a big different to the sound of your ukulele. The strings you get with your ukulele are likely to be cheap and nasty. It’s worth replacing them with higher quality strings such as Worth or Aquila.
<br><br>
7. Don’t hold your ukulele too tightly. The ukulele is small and it’s very easy to smother the sound out of it. Don’t hold it too tightly or you’ll lose a lot of volume and tone. Watch how masters like Jake Shimabukuro and hold the uke.
<br><br>
8. Listen to lots of ukulele players. The more you listen, the more you’ll get a feel for the ukulele and the way it sounds. It will influence how you play subconsciously.
<br><br>
9. Take the time to tune up properly. The ukulele isn’t the easiest instrument to get in tune and keep in tune, but it has to be done. If your ukulele is out of tune, you WILL sound terrible. I’m looking at you, Mr Merritt.
<br><br>
10. Enjoy yourself. The big appeal of the ukulele is that it is the most fun instrument around. People try to denigrate the ukulele as a toy. I think calling the uke a toy is a huge compliment. Toys are fun to play with and so is the ukulele.

陈忱和他一琴一箫的江南情怀<br><br>

2014-09-16  孙若茜 三联生活周刊

<br><br>

陈忱吹箫师承戴树红，弹奏古琴师承林有仁，都是大家。他亲手做箫，但不做琴。箫之于琴就像合奏时的感觉，若隐若现，若即若离。没有真正出现在利益圈中，不需要由琴箫带来太多现实的利益和回报，也就少了很多现世的困扰。他说并不希望箫热起来，至少不要像琴那样热。
<br><br>
陈忱不是无锡人，但定居在那里。他从小就向往文人士大夫的生活，无锡让他拥有了两人两狗，一琴一箫的日子。
<br><br>
琴和箫，是陈忱所认为此种生活中最不可缺少的两样。有趣的是，琴箫合奏，古琴大热，但箫是冷门。热则热到一张古琴开价上百万元，冷则冷得专业的音乐院校都罕有专门教授吹奏箫的专业课程。<br><br>

陈忱两样都爱，吹箫师承戴树红，弹奏古琴师承林有仁，都是大家。唯有一点不同，他亲手做箫，但不做琴。箫之于琴就像合奏时的感觉，若隐若现，若即若离。没有真正出现在利益圈中，不需要由琴箫带来太多现实的利益和回报，也就少了很多现世的困扰。他说并不希望箫热起来，至少不要像琴那样热。<br><br>

箫要吹出声调，就至少要一段时间的练习。除此之外，箫的音量相对小，在舞台上既不讨喜又不出彩。用陈忱的话说："加花显得浮躁，不加又显得平淡，观众往往喜欢看个热闹，但只有极为安静舒适的环境，才适合听箫。"
<br><br>
陈忱爱箫的音色，也爱箫这件乐器本身。"所谓箫声剑气，把箫从包里抽出来演奏，很像是宝剑出鞘，自有一股情怀在里面。"倘若做箫的手艺和演奏的技艺可以放在一个平台上考量，很难说陈忱哪样会更胜一筹。
<br><br>
为琴箫往来移居无锡<br><br>

陈忱成长在典型的知识分子家庭。父亲是上海人，年轻时过着富裕的民国老派生活，对儿子的教育偏重传统，什么时候背什么诗做什么事，按部就班。虽然陈忱没有出生在上海，所受教育却足以让他的心一早就住进了江南，爱上琴和箫也是在诵读诗词歌赋的自然而然间。
<br><br>
他知道以琴、箫谋生很困难，所以一开始就没有过这样的打算。父母都是大学老师，他的职业规划也一直就是到大学里去教书，没有所谓子承父业，而就是为了稳定的收入、不用坐班的自由时间、漫长的寒暑假--这些正是能保证他有大量精力去研习琴和箫的必要条件。他严格按照自己的规划行事，留学归国后，就在广东一所大学教书，和父母生活在一起。
<br><br>
最终移居到无锡，还是因为和琴、箫。要从他拜师开始讲起，好奇为何无论学哪样陈忱都可以拜在大师门下。"执著。"回答时，他的神情里并没有我想象中那种经常在他人脸上出现的得意，眉宇间的淡然让这两个字听起来像是可以不断创造奇迹。
<br><br>
当时是1993年，陈忱正在大学毕业前的实习，临时住在上海十六铺码头，靠近黄浦江边的一个地下防空洞里。那时候，他早已爱上了戴树红老师的琴声，想拜他为师。"投师无门啊，难不成贸贸然就去音乐学院里找他？当时没这个胆量。"嘴上说没胆，心里又不甘。陈忱就一遍遍从住处走到汾阳路上的上海音乐学院，盼着能和戴老师偶遇。一来一回十几公里，花费一整个下午，今天没有遇上，隔天又去。"心里面就是猫抓一样，如果你追过星，应该就能懂那种感觉。"但奇迹始终没有出现。
<br><br>
看上去事情已经不了了之了，他也结束实习离开了上海。但他说："我还是想着，一定要随戴老师学。"陈忱的执著不是那种气宇轩昂的信誓旦旦，几次交谈间，他口中的"一定"永远是平淡的，但又笃定。那时候电话刚刚开始向普通家庭普及不久，打"114"还可以查到私人电话，陈忱就抱着试一试的心态把电话打到了戴老师家里。
<br><br>
方式是否唐突冒失就好像已经不重要了，他在电话里用箫吹奏了一段曲给戴树红听。听后恩师说："你自学能吹到这个地步，有机会可以来上海面授一下。"就这样，陈忱从戴树红的电话学生做起，开始了二人的师徒关系。
<br><br>
在广东的工作有了足够的时间。但距离戴树红所在的上海太远，不方便向老师学习，增进琴艺太难。"人总是这样，得陇望蜀。"陈忱回忆那时："每天拿着张岱的《西湖梦寻》，都是江南忆。"35岁，他决定调工作到无锡，当然还是继续当大学老师。这样一来离戴老师近了很多，可以更加紧密地学习。<br><br>

无锡宜居，比之直接到上海生活，似乎能更轻松舒适许多。到无锡前，还在试想如今这里是否依然有单纯的琴箫往来，没想到陈忱家的书房就是朋友们的雅集之所。琴、箫，有时还有三弦、尺八，你一曲我一曲地谈谈唱唱，喝茶聊天但不问家长里短。陈忱说，也不局限无锡本地，现在的交通便利，上海、苏州，包括镇江，凡是江南的琴友都方便经常在此小聚，用他们自己的话说："有点儿江湖的味道。"
<br><br>
为琴箫合奏而生的"今虞雅箫"<br><br>

琴箫往来的乐趣到底有多大？这个很难形容。但就是为了琴箫合奏，民国时有人专门将普通的箫改良，成为今虞雅箫，多少也可见玩得是多么兴味盎然了。<br><br>

今虞雅箫的创始人是彭祉卿、查阜西、张子谦，三位琴家当时合称"浦东三杰"，创立了今虞琴社。他们发现，从明清就开始有的琴箫合奏其实多半是在意淫，音不和谐的原因在于箫音不准。
<br><br>
1937年出版的《今虞琴刊》上这样记述道："每笛七孔旋转可吹七调。盖以七声匀排者。为今之箫笛所从仿也。其调虽多。实无一能得其正。故今之箫笛。全赖善吹者善用口唇俯仰。"形容合奏的人"听之既惯。耳聪有所闭塞。虽不协者亦误以为协耳"。
<br><br>
按此说，那时的琴箫合奏并没有几个音能合准，听的人习以为常便不以为然，恐怕还硬要听出一种味道。但味道毕竟不能代替音准。因此，彭祉卿三人合力研究，将箫修改定型，又请苏州、贵州玉屏的乐器制作师辅以左右，终于得以实现。相比普通的六孔箫，今虞雅箫将指孔的数目增加到了八孔，弥补了原来没有半音孔的缺陷，使转调更加方便，转调后的音准更加准确。另外，为了与古琴相合时音量不显粗鲁，雅箫的管径设计较细，外径只有17～18毫米左右，这样在外形上也更符合江南文人审美情趣。
<br><br>
今虞雅箫诞生之初，以"沪上箫王"孙裕德先生的吹奏为最好，孙先生为了将它用以与丝竹合奏，稍稍扩大了管径，以增加音量，称文曲洞箫。到了当代，传习者即演奏家戴树红，他与制箫大师邹叙生长期合作，又从演奏经验上将今虞雅箫进行了数据化的规范：琴箫的管径增加到20～22毫米，文曲洞箫的管径定在22～23毫米范围，在演奏中通过口劲来控制音量，而不是由管径的直接变细来控制总体的音量上限，扩大了琴箫的音量变化范围，也发展了演奏技巧。因此，我们现在所说的今虞雅箫就包括了最早的细管径琴箫，亦简称雅箫，当代的琴箫以及丝竹文曲所用的洞箫，共三种。<br><br>
制箫以让吹箫自由<br><br>

陈忱所吹奏和制作的箫，都属今虞雅箫。在过去的两代演奏者中，没有人亲手制箫。戴树红与邹叙生的合作，是演奏者与乐器制作者最普遍的合作方式。但陈忱希望有所改变，他认为，好的乐器就像是自己的兵器，演奏的水平越高，对乐器的要求就越高，也才越能做得更好。反过来，量身定做的乐器对于自己的演奏会有很大的帮助，对音量、音色的选择都更加自由。因此，他一面和戴树红学吹箫，一面和邹叙生学做箫。<br><br>

陈忱告诉我，通常对于一个演奏者来说，一管箫是不够的，不同的箫之间会有调上的区别，一般会相差一到两个全音。以比较通俗的方法举例为E、F、G、A四个调，从低到高，演奏用得最多的是F调和G调。F调多数用来和古琴合奏，G调与江南丝竹合奏。在今虞雅箫的范畴里，A调音高，听起来更像笛子，所以用得也少，E调也只有个别特殊的曲子会用到。因此，从演奏上说，首先至少要有两管箫。而吹管乐器和弦乐器不同，受温度影响，气体流动的速度改变，冬天和夏天的音高是不一样的：一款在夏天标准的箫，到了冬天，音就低了。冬天音刚好的箫，到夏天音就高了，此一来又要多备上两管箫。<br><br>

并不是只有专业的演奏者需要很多管箫，初学者也一样。刚开始时有的音是吹不上去的。"比如同一款箫同一个孔，你吹的mi就没有我吹的音高。这和气力、吹奏所用的肌肉锻炼有很大关系。"所以陈忱为自己刚刚开始学习的学生做箫，就不会把音孔做到标准的位置，而视学生的情况来定。"功力达到一定水准后，气息已经可以顶上去了，第一管箫就相当于报废了，第二管给他的箫，音孔的位置就可以下调。"他觉得，用统一化的箫，让初学者一直听自己吹出不准的音，并不是好的学习体验，不如循序渐进。而只有亲手制作上的随心所欲，才可以在教学上实现这样的阶梯式训练。另外，箫是易耗品，演奏用箫平均几年就会因竹子开裂而报废掉一管。
<br><br>
这些不同演奏功用的箫，对陈忱来说，在制作上都游刃有余。他说如果精益求精，自己甚至可以根据每个人的唇形不同，做出最适合他们吹奏的箫。他已经不是一个新手了。在几年前做出第一根箫时，他就曾说过："为了这支箫，我准备了十几年。"准备，并不是时常动手的训练，是从大学开始，就打算自己做箫，因而开始对于音律、管律的学习。
<br><br>
真正考验制箫水准的，并不是这些实用主义的箫，而是雅箫，纯粹的赏玩之物。陈忱给我看了一支他送给妻子的箫，是用上乘的梅鹿竹所做，竹节均匀，黄色蜡底上棕黑色的菌斑清晰不晕，整根竹子光泽温润。因竹材的纤细，这管箫的管径比一般的箫细很多，显得格外修长和轻盈，箫上的指孔大小一致，且并不是呆板的正圆，而是椭圆。箫的整体光洁，没有辅以其他材料的装点，独显竹材的高洁之美。只有尾部缀挂了一小块阳绿色的翡翠加以点缀，并不过分夺人眼球，平添几分生机。盈握在手中更觉得这管箫是一件艺术品，每一处细节都可以仔细端详反复玩味，它也代表了雅箫追求的审美趣味。
<br><br>
闲谈间，陈忱用它吹奏了一曲《鬲溪梅令》，正是姜白石路过无锡时所作的词。音量轻弱，聆听时不由得更要集中精力，屏住呼吸，而此声音的大小在书房却是再好不过。箫声虽然有如梦境，却没有呜咽的无力。他说，箫本就该有这样一股中正之气，以往我们听得太多的呜呜咽咽，多是被故意渲染，有失箫的本色。
<br><br>
陈忱说，像这样的雅箫，演奏的功用已经几乎完全为审美让步。以这支箫为例，除了他之外，几乎没人可以拿来吹奏乐曲。就因为太细，如果没有足够的演奏功底训练，吹响都是个问题。但作为一件乐器，制作时却不能忽略它的声音以及音准。所以，雅箫制作的难度和限制之一也在于此，若都不能吹响何谈校音。
<br><br>
制作上的其他难点也基本都是由它的细带来的，在不去竹青的情况下，陈忱已经可以将雅箫的管径做到14.5到15.5毫米之间，按照比例，指孔也要相应地小，这样一来，打孔的位置就容不得丁点马虎，哪怕是1毫米的差距也会让音准跑调，而且后期无法弥补。
<br><br>
另外，陈忱制箫虽有师承，但前人传下来的工具并不完全适合做这一细再细的雅箫。因此，他的工作间里有很多大大小小的工具都是自己的改良，打孔的刀、用以打通竹节的钢条等等，都有极为细微但十分关键的改造。他由此猜想，在今虞雅箫诞生前，之所以箫音不准，大概也和古代在制作工艺、工具的局限上有很大的关系。"比如打通一个竹节，工具首先要细，硬度够而且要有韧性。只有炼钢的工业发展到了一定程度，工具才可能更得心应手，也因此雅箫才得以出现在民国。"
<br><br>
用来做今虞雅箫的竹子通常有三种，紫竹、黄竹和斑竹。前两种竹子常用在琴箫或洞箫上，它们放在一起有着反差很大的颜色之美：紫竹色深，沉稳；而黄竹黄白如玉，十分优雅。挑选上主要在意的是竹节之美，要有一定的竹节数，而每一个竹节又要在规范的长度之内，以保证制作时，指孔不需要打在节上，失去美观。斑竹是稀有的野生品种，分为梅鹿竹和湘妃竹两种，同样是蜡黄底色，两种竹斑的颜色不同，一黑一红，形状上很像是落花。这种竹子以花美为上，挑选时不看竹节只看花，是用来做雅箫的材料。
<br><br>
竹子除了品种上的差异，质量上当然更是千差万别。因此挑选能够做箫的竹材是个浩大的工程。陈忱说这些品种大多生长在皖南、浙西、赣北。最初，他是和朋友到当地的竹林一棵一棵地找，拿着尺子量，看上哪棵就告诉工人在哪儿截断。但想找到一根合适的竹材往往是万里挑一，这个方法不免显得有些笨拙和费力。之后，他们给出标准，委托竹农去采，竹农毕竟是第一手的海选，找得差不多了，就打电话说："有两万根合适的，你们来吧。"依然要一根一根过手去挑，粗细、厚度、韧性、竹节的长短等等最后大概也就挑出200根。当然，剩下的也必须买单，因此，从各方面来讲，成本都算极高。
<br><br>
买回来的竹子，还有二次的筛选和淘汰，比如说做箫的竹子一定要5年生，超过5年就已经衰老了，而不到5年，放置一段时间表面就会发皱，4年半的竹子和5年生的原本就相差不大，因此经常被看走眼。此外，一般的竹材陈忱都会放上两年，等水分完全挥发之后才能制作成箫，这个过程中还会有竹子开裂造成的损耗。
<br><br>
能做雅箫的斑竹如今已经找不到了。"这种竹子只生长在湖南的南部和广西的北部。四五年前还有，可是市场对它的需求量太大，恶性地开采，糟蹋着使用，原始森林被破坏，它已经没有了生长的环境。"陈忱对自己从竹农手中收回的几十根梅鹿竹格外珍惜，早在梅雨季到来前，就用报纸里三层外三层地包裹了起来放在墙角。
<br><br>
更让他视若珍宝的，是朋友的一根湘妃竹。"这是到现在为止，我见过的唯一一根能做雅箫的湘妃竹。仅此一根。"也正因为这样，陈忱并没有想好什么时候将它制成雅箫。"要等到技艺万无一失的时候才能动手，这样的竹子简直是可遇不可求。"
<br><br>
问陈忱对于自己制作的雅箫有没有一个大概的价格定位。他说没有，虽然曾有人想买，但无法定价。他们夫妻二人在这件事上达成的共识是决不以此谋生，不用此牟利。"定了价格可能会把人家吓到，人家可能会说，不就一根竹子么，你们想钱想疯了？所以干脆就不考虑所谓市场。我们此生此世玩这个东西，把它做到一个高度，至于市场价值让后人评说或也可以。"

世无大师 书生一介<br><br>

摘要: 在学术界，汤一介是久负盛名的哲学史家，对儒学、道教、佛教皆有精深研究，并牵头编纂《中国佛教史》以及《儒藏》等大型丛书。<br><br>


华夏时报记者 李北辰 北京报道<br><br>

2014年5月4日，“五四”青年节，习近平去北京大学考察，行程中一项重要安排，是去拜访北大哲学系教授汤一介。CCTV当晚《新闻联播》里的画面是，87岁高龄的汤一介身着长衫，静候于门前，让人如沐君子之风。
<br><br>
在学术界，汤一介是久负盛名的哲学史家，对儒学、道教、佛教皆有精深研究，并牵头编纂《中国佛教史》以及《儒藏》等大型丛书。尽管人们已习惯为他扣上“大师”的帽子，但他却坦诚地认为，他不是大师，因为现在没有大师。
<br><br>
4个月后的9月9日，汤一介先生辞世。<br><br>

浮生若梦<br><br>

汤一介出自书香门第，父亲汤用彤是中国著名哲学研究者。在传统文人的观念里，他自然朴素地希望“子从父业”，也当个读书人，故取名“一介”，一介书生之意。
<br><br>
事实上，无论荣辱，汤一介的一生都是标准读书人的一生：除了政治运动将“最可能有创造力的时光白白度过”之外，基本都在读书、教书、写书和编书中度过。<br><br>

汤一介走上哲学研究之路似乎顺理成章。由于父亲汤用彤是西南联大哲学系主任（后任文学院院长），在精英荟萃的联大，少年汤一介经常可以看到父亲与金岳霖、冯友兰、钱穆、闻一多等学者探讨问题的场景。此后数年间，他也重复了那个时代读书人的标准轨迹：1946年，汤一介进入北大，大量阅读中外学术著作，还写了《论善》《论死》《论人为什么活着》等几篇颇为“形而上”的文章。
<br><br>
北大求学第二年，他正式考取了北大哲学系，毕业后留校任教，看似波澜不惊，但历史的更迭让汤一介的思想和人生轨迹都出现了拐点。
<br><br>
他曾回忆道：“我读高中时就幻想自己将来能做一个哲学家，推动中国哲学由传统走向现代。但1949年后，这种幻想逐渐消失，当时我和几乎所有学习和研究哲学的学生和教师都认为自己只能做一名‘哲学工作者’，而只有政治上的领袖如列宁、斯大林、毛泽东等才能做哲学家。”
<br><br>
从保存至今的资料中可以看出，作为一名典型的传统知识分子，汤一介无疑有着自己坚定的信念。身为1949年入党的老党员，汤一介中学时就接受了共产主义，还一度因《西行漫记》有了去延安的计划；然而，他却依然没有逃过“文革”劫难。在这段特殊年代，他被别人批斗过，也批斗过别人。这一切都令他感到迷茫。
<br><br>
“四人帮”倒台后，被隔离审查的汤一介忽然意识到一个问题：“我以后该听谁的？”他的反思是：“我之所以走了一大段弯路，主要是因为我没有用自己的头脑来思考问题。”
<br><br>
于是，他决定“只能听我自己的”。
<br><br>
一介书生
<br><br>
严格地说，上世纪80年代开始，汤一介才走上学术正轨。
<br><br>
1980年，北大恢复了他的讲课资格，他也从“唯物”和“唯心”的二元论中走出，开始了真正意义上的哲学研究，学术生涯自此进入井喷期。第二年，便发表了著名的《论中国传统哲学范畴体系诸问题》，并提出了“和而不同”、“普遍和谐”、“内在超越”、“中国解释学”、“新轴心时代”等诸多令人欣喜的理论。<br><br>

事实上，汤一介还是最早提倡“国学”的学者之一，但相较同辈学者们的热情，他无疑有着更为谨慎的态度，强调必须为“国学”加入“全球意识”的背景和语境：“第二次世界大战后，随着‘西方中心论’的消退，整个世界文化呈现出多元化发展趋势，这当然有益于文化的健康发展，但孤立地、盲目地提倡‘国学’，很可能使中国文化再次游离于世界文化发展的潮流之外。”
<br><br>
如今，在相当一部分当代学者眼中，提及“国学”或者儒学，至少应保持中立。汤一介也强调“不要把儒家意识形态化”，但他同时坦言：“从历史上看，儒学传统有两千多年，我们没法割断它。”
<br><br>
而在学术上，汤一介最后的梦想也与儒学有关。2004年，由教育部批准、北京大学主持制定，并由汤一介挂帅的《儒藏》编纂工作小组正式启动。众所周知，在此之前，道家有《道藏》，佛教有《佛藏》，儒学却并没有类似丛书，《儒藏》旨在填补这一空缺。其全本将收录中国历史上重要的儒学文献3000余种，约10亿字，计划2025年完成，规模将超《四库全书》。
<br><br>
汤一介并不掩饰自己的愿景，并流露出了也许是他学术生涯之中最掷地有声的言语：“我的梦想就是让我们的《儒藏》成为全世界最权威的范本。我的标准是，我编了《儒藏》之后，一百年不会有人来超过我，而且世界上通行的儒学研究的本子就是我这个本子。”这是一个典型“读书人”的豪言壮语。只可惜如今巨著未成，人已远去。
<br><br>
在回忆汤一介先生的文章中，几乎找不到什么有趣的故事，或者像其他同级别文人那样的轶闻。
<br><br>
作为一个传统的知识分子，汤一介还想要重复父亲的夙愿，希望下一代“子从父业”。只是时代变了，“我的孩子没有继承家学，他们上世纪80年代初就都去了美国。女儿在‘文革’结束前，受到的正规教育仅仅限于小学，儿子是物理学博士，但他没有做学术，现在在一家企业工作，薪水很高，他自己很满意，但我和他妈妈都不满意，因为毕竟我们的家风是读书人家。”
<br><br>
一介书生，心愿未了。

刘欢女儿以父为荣 刘熠思考上大学刘欢大哭<br><br>


2013年08月16日<br><br>


凤凰卫视8月15日《鲁豫有约》，以下为文字实录：<br><br>

解说：银婚二十五年，他们的婚姻如何依旧能够保鲜。<br><br>

三宝：刘欢在她的心目当中依然是神。<br><br>

水均益：她基本上的百分之九十九的时间是在看着她的丈夫。<br><br>

郑晓龙：特别深情的在那看着刘欢的那个眼神。<br><br>

解说：走下舞台，他是浪漫的刘欢，舞动着的刘欢，居家的刘欢，在荧幕上你看不到的刘欢。
<br><br>
卢璐：你看我特不顺眼的时候想过分手吗？<br><br>

刘欢：没有吧。<br><br>

解说：女儿丝丝首度献声，给刘欢夫妇带来何种惊喜？《鲁豫有约》说出你的故事，听刘欢、卢璐夫妇讲述二十五年银婚感悟。
<br><br>
从1988年到2013年，刘欢和卢璐已经牵手走过了二十五年的光阴，两人从一见钟情到九天相处情定终生，再到此次希腊银婚庆典，他们的爱情故事和幸福生活深深的打动着我们，此次希腊之行我们也希望能够通过对话寻找到他们的爱情，能够在二十五年后依旧保险的秘诀。
<br><br>
卢璐：我真的觉得他很有才，包括这么多年他有时候懒啊，不做呀，我一直坚信他就是他只要写东西他一定是很好的，这点任何时候我都坚信不移，真的我到现在，我现在跟你我也这么说，他现在展示给别人的或者给观众也好，歌迷也好，听众也好，他只是真的只是一部分，包括他在课堂上教课，他到现在我去听他课当他面吹我又不好意思。
<br><br>
陈鲁豫：没事。<br><br>

卢璐：你不会不意思啊？<br><br>

陈鲁豫：当他，当他不在。<br><br>

卢璐：对，我现在听他去讲课我仍然还会被他打动，还是很激动，我还是会觉得他讲得好。
<br><br>
陈鲁豫：我觉得你能够欣赏，欣赏自己爱的人这种感觉太好了。
<br><br>
卢璐：对，我就是欣赏他，我觉得我有时候跟他说，有时候我都怀疑是不是对他没有，并不爱了啊，只是欣赏，但是等到他写，就是前两年那个写《甄执》的那个旋律一出来，当时我们在美国度假嘛，中秋节的时候，他那个旋律一出来，哎呦，我马上那种，那种心疼的感觉我马上觉得哎呀我自己我后来我跟你说没有，我觉得我还是爱他的。
<br><br>
《甄执》主题曲《凤凰于飞》：如雾里看花，水中望月飘来又浮去，军君来有声，君去无语翻云覆雨里。
<br><br>
三宝：这么多年了刘欢在她的心目当中依然是神，依然是王子，白马王子。
<br><br>
水均益：然后卢璐呢有时候就会坐在旁边，然后听我们俩聊，其实我那时候感觉她对我们俩聊的很多东西也不是特别感兴趣，但是她就愿意陪着，当然那个时候她基本上的百分之九十九的时间是在看着她的丈夫。
<br><br>
郑晓龙：她能看着刘欢那个眼神，你有时候能看到她那个眼神，看到她踏歌特别专注的，或者有时候特别，特别深情的在那看着刘欢那个眼神，你会觉得。<br><br>

卢璐：挺欣赏你的，怎么着，你让我怎么办呢这是。
<br><br>
刘欢：打起来了。<br><br>

陈鲁豫：但是爱一个特别有才华的人是一件挺辛苦的事。
<br><br>
卢璐：辛苦，真的。
<br><br>
陈鲁豫：因为一个人他有才华的话那这个人真的不能够是百分之百只属于你的。
<br><br>
卢璐：对，对，对。<br><br>

陈鲁豫：因为他的才华一定是要跟，不能说全世界，是要跟很多人去分享的。
<br><br>
卢璐：但是这点我不一样，我特别愿意跟大家分享，我总觉得我不能独占他，我就总觉得他还有很多才华没有展示出来。满足。我不会唱和声，哎呦真好看。<br><br>

刘欢：它就都靠左行驶，因为桨在右边，你看这平常划着划着就伸腿去踩一脚。
<br><br>
卢璐：我觉得浪漫是必须的，真的就是再不浪漫就老了，就这句话。
<br><br>
刘欢：我觉得所谓浪漫就是你，你可能永远会你感受到那个爱情的存在，当然在我这个年龄上是这样。
<br><br>
卢璐：我因为嫁给刘欢我会有很多考虑，我会为了他我会考虑很多东西，会其实是会牺牲一些自我，但是到这个岁数我也想明白了，很多东西属于我们自己的，有些浪漫的东西没必要，真的喜欢你的人他就会跟你分享，不喜欢你的人真的你怎么着他也不喜欢你，所以我觉得我们的一切的形式，一切浪漫是要愉悦我们自己，愉悦喜欢我们的人，愉悦喜欢美好的人。
<br><br>
陈鲁豫：人是会在改变的，会成长的，比如你这个阶段可能跟你之前的三十岁的时候是不一样的，那你未来，五十到六十，六十到七十还会有不同的改变，会也不同的状态。
<br><br>
卢璐：我之前没有这样的要求，我之前是我真的是任劳任怨，我不会想我自己，是到最近，具体说来四十五岁以后，所以我觉得宋丹丹说的那个话，我有时跟他说。
<br><br>
陈鲁豫：她说什么了？
<br><br>
卢璐：宋丹丹说得那个话特别对，她说女人的要求是在变的，男人的要求是不变的嘛，都要对女人的要求该是年轻漂亮，这个是永远不变的，二十多岁的时候你会要求男的外表要高，到三十多岁的时候会要求男的有能力，到四十岁以后你会要求男的爱我就行，我年轻的时候根本无所谓，只要我爱他，所以我会到最近两年我才会跟老刘表示一些不满，我会突然觉得我也会希望有人哄我，有人关注我，有人对我说好话，哪怕是不说违心的吧，哄我两句我都愿意听。<br><br>

陈鲁豫：但你还是挺有意思的，你在小事上不去哄她，大事上其实你真的在哄她。
<br><br>
刘欢：算是这样吧。<br><br>

卢璐：我觉得就是啊，对啊，被你这么一说是，这也叫哄。<br><br>

陈鲁豫：我觉得写书做这样的事情这比平常我哄你一下，迁就你一下，其实大的多。我觉得八零后、九零后可能好一点，像七零后、六零后，总得来说还是比较乖的我觉得。<br><br>

刘欢：对。<br><br>

陈鲁豫：就内心会有很多疯狂浪漫的想法，但是很少敢去付诸行动的。<br><br>

刘欢：对，尤其我这种又是宅男是吧，天天能泡在家里，好咖啡。<br><br>

陈鲁豫：你真不应该这样，我觉得做音乐的人内心是特浪漫特有激情的。<br><br>

卢璐：对呀。<br><br>

刘欢：但是我就是能宅得住，确实是。<br><br>

卢璐：他还挺得意的他觉得。<br><br>

陈鲁豫：我觉得宅，宅没关系的，但是你偶尔应该有一些想法是你应该去付诸实施，是不太按常理出牌的。
<br><br>
刘欢：所以就是这算是一开始吧，以后就那个啊。<br><br>

陈鲁豫：也不会改太大，突然这个人到这时候突然改变，你也不太能适应了。这么多年这个人证明他是一个特别可靠的一个人，在情感上是让你放心的一个人。<br><br>

卢璐：对，靠谱。<br><br>

陈鲁豫：我看你书里面写你曾经真的问过他，就你问他你说这么多年你有没有碰到过特别动心的女孩儿，异性？
<br><br>
卢璐：他是觉得漂亮女孩儿到处都有，不意味着她一定要属于你，我一定要得到她。
<br><br>
刘欢：我在这方面的思维可能是属于那一类人吧，老套的，我觉得你这男人这种女人的吧，反正就是这种事你一旦选了那就是你整个你选了一条道，你也选了一个人，然后呢你就意味着你这辈子就这么过了。
<br><br>
陈鲁豫：但很多人会觉得当初我是这么选的，后来我觉得这个路可能不太适合我，我再换一条路走。
<br><br>
刘欢：那对，那也是，也有这种可能性，但是对我来说我觉得就是我就这样选了，那我就这样做了。
<br><br>
陈鲁豫：你觉得婚姻的誓言是必须要去，要去遵守的。
<br><br>
刘欢：对，你既然打算结婚，打算生孩子，打算娶老婆，那么OK，那就这样了。
<br><br>
卢璐：他说他碰到我之后他才意识到他应该是找这样的人，过这样的生活，他说也可乐要是没碰到我，他可能去做摇滚了。
<br><br>
刘欢：就是你没有遇到你是不知道的，所以就现在我老觉得就包括谈恋爱现在的婚嫁这种电视，好多这种节目，就是说你找那个男朋友也好，女朋友，你想找一个什么样的，其实我一直认为你永远都不知道，你遇到了你才知道。
<br><br>
陈鲁豫：对。<br><br>

刘欢：你遇到那个人你要她够是我要找的那样的。
<br><br>
卢璐：对。<br><br>
刘欢：然后你在没遇到这个人之前你看。<br><br>

卢璐：会提很多条件啊。<br><br>

刘欢：那提的那条件那都是胡扯我觉得。<br><br>

陈鲁豫：对。<br><br>

刘欢：我要这样的，那身高什么年龄这那，那都是胡扯。
<br><br>
陈鲁豫：我也觉得瞎掰。<br><br>

刘欢：你遇到了你就知道了，她就是这样的。
<br><br>
 
解说：走下舞台，他是居家的刘欢，在荧幕上你看不到的刘欢。
<br><br>
卢璐：看我特不顺眼的时候想过分手吗？
<br><br>
刘欢：没有吧。
<br><br>
解说：女儿丝丝首度献声，给刘欢夫妇带来何种惊喜，《鲁豫有约》说出你的故事，听刘欢、卢璐夫妇讲述二十五年银婚感悟。
<br><br>
陈鲁豫：我和团队飞跃七千多公里，来到全球最浪漫的海岛，希腊的圣托里尼岛，我们会尽自己所能给刘欢夫妇一个难忘的银婚庆典。
<br><br>
解说：两个人相遇是一种缘分，之后能一直坚守则需要一份爱的承诺，刘欢和卢璐的爱情正是如此，他们在婚后长久的相处时光中，依旧彼此欣赏偶尔去营造浪漫，懂得爱的坚持。
<br><br>
梅楣（刘欢、卢璐好友）：我一直觉得卢璐是个特别幸福的女人，因为她在家连做饭的资格都没有。
<br><br>
李国威（刘欢同学）：我印象中刘欢除了他的音乐创作啊、唱歌之外，他在生活上有这么几个爱好或者说特长吧，第一是做饭。
<br><br>
珊珊：刘欢煲的汤可是真的好喝啊，这可是个小秘密。
<br><br>
解说：在朋友的采访中，我们了解到了刘欢生活中让我们意想不到的一面，热爱厨艺的他到底手艺如何，这次希腊圆梦之旅我们特意做了一个安排，来考验一下家庭煮夫刘欢。
<br><br>
刘熠思（刘欢女儿）：Hello，我们今天来某品牌超市，这边希腊居然有某品牌超市，我们来超市的目的呢是因为晚上一会儿我爸爸妈妈要做饭，然后呢我们，我和他们四个学员过来，给他们挑一些原料，原料其实那边好像据说酒店那边已经有了，主要的材料比如说肉啊，或者是面什么之类的，所以我们到这边来主要是挑一些香料，还有蔬菜，还有一些我们也不认识的东西，做这件事情的目的不光是为了为难他们，也是为了为难我爸妈，他们呢我们给他们选什么材料他们就得做什么材料，所以呢他们的命运掌握在我们的手上，然后呢我现在我负责给他们分组，因为我是多余了，所以他们两个人两个人一组，所以女士们一组，女士们一组呢负责。
<br><br>
女：女士们一组吗？男人过。
<br><br>
刘熠思：负责挑肉和香料，因为如果要女的挑，挑菜的话就太，太正常了对不对，一点挑战性都没有，然后让男的来挑蔬菜我觉得。
<br><br>
男：我喜欢。
<br><br>
刘熠思：好的，那就。
<br><br>
男：开始捡石头。
<br><br>
刘熠思：好，那我们就走吧。
<br><br>
男：走吧。
<br><br>
女：那就开始为难吧，走。
<br><br>
刘熠思：是这样的啊，我们现在我们不知道原料就是那边准备了什么原料，所以我们现在只能猜，我们不知道那边有什么肉，也不知道有什么面条，但是我们就凑合着买，比如说这包米我们现在先拿着。
<br><br>
女：这不是米。
<br><br>
男：洋葱是必要的，洋葱是肯定必要的。这算蔬菜吧？
<br><br>
土豆算蔬菜，当然算蔬菜。
<br><br>
刘熠思：茴香酒，这个本身是种饮料在这边。
<br><br>
女：就是喝起来像大料一样，本身就是大料的那个味道。
<br><br>
刘熠思：对，炖红烧肉啊什么的，但是单喝也可以，我爸喜欢喝所以咱们就给他买一个。
<br><br>
男：扔。
<br><br>
刘熠思：我妈妈主要是做一些家常菜，或者辣的啊什么的，然后我爸爸什么都可以做，他比较多元化。
<br><br>
女：但昨天好像姑姑说那个说，说你爸老抢着。
<br><br>
刘熠思：对，因为我爸爸喜欢做菜，他享受做菜，然后做菜时他不愿意别人帮忙。
<br><br>
女：肉，鱼。
<br><br>
刘熠思：肉在那边，我妈妈会做炒西瓜皮，这是她夏天喜欢做的一个菜。
<br><br>
女：这个是唯一估计是我吃过的菜了，圣托里尼岛只有三个岛，有一个叫费拉，还有一个叫伊亚，第三个我也不知道叫什么。
<br><br>
女：不是三个岛是三个镇。
<br><br>
男：烂导游，下课。
<br><br>
刘熠思：小径通幽处。
<br><br>
一起：surprise。
<br><br>
男：surprise。
<br><br>
刘欢：OK。
<br><br>
男：我买了好多东西哦。
<br><br>
女：今天我买了很多不认识的菜。
<br><br>
刘熠思：原来还有阴谋。
<br><br>
刘欢：这是什么？
<br><br>
男：这是西红柿。
<br><br>
卢璐：我觉得这是畸形吧。
<br><br>
刘熠思：这都是。<br><br>
男：没有，它那一篮子都是那样的，我们专门拿的。
<br><br>
刘欢：转基因。
<br><br>
卢璐：转基因。
<br><br>
刘熠思：转基因的，西瓜，炒西瓜皮。
<br><br>
刘欢：这是什么？<br><br>

卢璐：这个西瓜皮太薄了。<br><br>

女：对，我就说了嘛，西瓜皮太薄了嘛。
<br><br>
刘熠思：我们是应该帮着他们做吗？
<br><br>
卢璐：是啊，你帮我们洗，洗。
<br><br>
女：但是他们操作的时候我们得。
<br><br>
卢璐：你们得走开。
<br><br>
陈鲁豫：卢璐告诉我呢刘欢平常特别喜欢待在家里，喜欢做家务，喜欢做饭，而且厨艺非常的好，他常常会给家人做好吃的，而且会留一些挺有意思的，挺感性的话写在小条上，那天我看卢璐发了一条微信，上面就是一张照片，照片是一个锅，里面有一锅茶叶蛋，那是刘欢早些时候做的，他还留了条上面就写着我做了鸡蛋，非常的香，鸡蛋呢画了一只鸡，下了一个蛋，这张照片我看了之后特别的感动，我想刘欢那种很生活化的一面是平常我们从电视上看不到的，那今天在希腊这么美的圣岛他的学员们提前去买了蔬菜水果，还有各种各样的原材料，然后等一下我们会品尝，看看谁做的比较好吃，他们在忙着，我去看看他们准备要做一些什么。
<br><br>
画中音：服务生吗？
<br><br>
NO。<br><br>

摄影师。<br><br>

NO、NO。
<br><br>
磨剪子来戗菜刀。
<br><br>
刘欢：哎呀同志们啊，我发现现在完全是乱了呀。
<br><br>
画中音：给它想一个浪漫的名字嘛。
<br><br>
陈鲁豫：圣岛土豆丝。
<br><br>
刘欢：看上去还行，OK，洗锅，对不起。
<br><br>
卢璐：这是咸还是淡我都不知道，好像一点辣味都没有哎。
<br><br>
陈鲁豫：好香啊，我端了一个横菜。
<br><br>
卢璐：一帮食客，这名字都不愿想了你看。
<br><br>
陈鲁豫：你拿了片柠檬片太无聊了你，不是一家人不进一家门，这土豆丝跟这菜你不觉得特别像吗？形状也像，作法也像。
<br><br>
男：我懂了这是两个人炒的。
<br><br>
画中音：长得像土豆丝的那个叫芹菜根丝。
<br><br>
谁炒的。<br><br>

这个土豆丝真好吃，有米饭吗就一点。
<br><br>
男：绝对是刘老师做的。
<br><br>
陈鲁豫：为什么？为什么？
<br><br>
卢璐：这么看不起我。
<br><br>
男：不是，不是，因为我是在。
<br><br>
陈鲁豫：这是，这是他做的啊，那这个呢？这个得吃。
<br><br>
卢璐：这挺好吃的。
<br><br>
女：这个应该是，应该是姑姑做的。
<br><br>
画中音：刘老师。
<br><br>
这个应该是刘老师。
<br><br>
因为这有辣椒在里面。
<br><br>
这还没猜呢。
<br><br>
这个是刘老师做的，这个是刘老师做的。
<br><br>
这个是姑姑做的，这个也是姑姑做的。
<br><br>
陈鲁豫：好，我来揭晓啊，这个是刘老师做的。
<br><br>
一起：耶。
<br><br>
陈鲁豫：土豆丝刘老师做的。
<br><br>
一起：耶。
<br><br>
陈鲁豫：这个叫芹菜根丝是卢璐姐做的。
<br><br>
一起：耶，这是谁做的？我刚刚没看到，是你做的吧？
<br><br>
卢璐：秋葵。
<br><br>
陈鲁豫：秋葵，你可以啊，做这么多。<br><br>
解说：2008年北京奥运会后他为何突然淡出观众视野？
<br><br>
刘欢：我觉得这是最最要紧的时刻，可能咱们中国人都是这样，为了孩子可以不惜一切。
<br><br>
解说：女儿丝丝首度献声，给刘欢夫妇带来何种惊喜，刘欢和女儿之间又有何私家故事？
<br><br>
刘熠思：我觉得我小的时候都跟他不熟，就是太少接触了，我小时候挺怕他的，《鲁豫有约》说出你的故事，听刘欢、卢璐夫妇讲述二十五年银婚感悟。刘欢的女儿刘熠思小名丝丝，出生于1991年，是个典型的北京女孩儿，开朗、大气，同时也有着九零后特立独行的个性和酷劲儿。<br><br>

刘欢：OK，出发。<br><br>

卢璐：你说她车也不会开，竟然会开船。
<br><br>
刘欢：欢迎回来。<br><br>

杨茉（刘欢卢璐好友女儿）：虽然我没见过丝丝，但是每次就听叔叔阿姨聊天，就她是一个特别有个性的孩子。
<br><br>
刘熠思：小时候因为主要是跟她（妈妈）相处，所以经常吵架，经常吵得不可开交，吵得我们两个人最后都哭，然后到大了以后就是我也是慢慢也意识到我跟她吵也没什么好后果，就是比如说就不理。
<br><br>
解说：2007年秋刘欢夫妇将女儿送到美国就读高中，基于女儿“骄养”的考虑，夫妇俩开始了三年的陪读生活，头两年卢璐全陪，刘欢则每月飞去探望，被母女俩戏称为“月父”，2009年是丝丝报考大学关键的一年，所以北京奥运会结束不久刘欢就在人们的视野中消失了，他没有半点迟疑，在女儿最需要的时候出现在她身边。
<br><br>
刘熠思：我当时觉得不需要，我现在想太需要了。
<br><br>
解说：一年多的朝夕相处多少弥补了刘欢对女儿儿时未能悉心陪伴的一丝歉疚，父女日渐情深。
<br><br>
刘熠思：爸爸是因为小的时候他那会还更多是在工作方面，所以不是经常在家里，我说，说直接点我觉得我小时候跟他都不熟，就是都不，少，太少接触了，小时候挺怕他的，而且他本身也是一个就是怎么说呢，就特别给有一种，有一种很奇怪的气场往那一坐，就不干嘛，别人都挺害怕他的那种，其实并没有，很和蔼，后来我觉着从初中结尾，然后从正式从高中开始，他开始我也不知道是不是因为有什么具体的事情，还是只是年龄到了而已，更喜欢在家里待着了，然后呢更多的关心我，然后是就是所谓那种爸爸疼女儿的那种感觉泛滥了就是。
<br><br>
刘欢：我记得一次她给我写过一个生日的时候写过一个东西，那次是我觉得她看到我了，她前面写的什么都我不记得，就有一句话希望你白头发蔓延的速度慢一点，这句话我印象很深，我觉得那是她在注意，注意过我，她看到我了，就说明她心里边是有我们的。
<br><br>
解说：2009年12月16日，刘熠思提前半年拿到了纽约大学电影学院的录取通知书。
<br><br>
郑晓龙：我的印象特别深，就是那年丝丝考上纽约大学的时候，刘欢大哭一场，就是丝丝的成长，长大最后上大学，孩子的教育终于成功，为她付出了很多的心血。
<br><br>
刘熠思：就看到被录取了以后就我们三个人就完全都崩溃了，其实我爸爸是最激动的。
<br><br>
刘欢：我觉得这是最最要紧的时刻，就其实人一生有很多那个就是关键时刻，其实这个关键时刻你说怎么，怎么关键，就是它忽然那一，那一个瞬间起的那个变化可能有，有可能决定你以后的这一辈子的这事，可能咱们中国人都是这样，为了孩子可以不惜一切。
<br><br>
解说：2011年刘欢做客鲁豫现场，一向不善于直接表露情感的女儿给他写来了一封信。
<br><br>
陈鲁豫：你女儿信是这么写的，爸，新年好，这应该是长大以后第一次给你写东西吧，不知道该说些什么，妈妈常说我不会说好话，不示弱，不会哄人，其实我心里都明白，有很多话我想我不说你也是可以明白的，这两年来你为我付出了太多，没有几个爸爸可以为自己的女儿做到这些，你病的时候纵然我嘴上不说，心真的疼得很，还好，我们也都算小熬了过来，步入了我们各自人生中的另一个阶段，此时此刻，我只想说谢谢你爸爸，我以你为荣，希望你跟妈妈能够一直开心幸福还有健康，丝丝。
<br><br>
刘欢：很高兴，真的，她，她真的没给我直接写过信，至少没有这种装在信封里的信，而且我跟女儿之间的交流呢感觉上好像多少一直有一点，像有一点障碍一样，就是不知道为什么她这孩子她从来不会很直接的表达说我心疼你呀，我喜欢你呀，这句话是永远你都听不到的，我好像跟她之间呢也是变成这样，我就我仔细去想，哪次我会直接跟她说一声，我说姑娘，我喜欢你啊什么，我好像我也不会这样去讲。
<br><br>
解说：此次希腊银婚之旅刘熠思也为父母准备了一份特别的惊喜。
<br><br>
卢璐：可能观众朋友们都不一定相信，我和刘欢从来没听过我女儿在我们面前唱过歌。
<br><br>
刘熠思：我本身就一直有障碍在，在别人面前唱歌。
<br><br>
卢璐：她那么喜欢音乐。
<br><br>
刘熠思：在别人面前我是开不了口的。
<br><br>
卢璐：乐感又那么好，但是她从来不敢在我们面前唱，反正做，做的这件事情是，是非常违背我原则的。
<br><br>
陈鲁豫：这时候应该放一首歌对吧，你从来应该还没听过吧，我们也都没听过的，丝丝的歌，丝丝你淡定。
<br><br>
刘熠思：Day  in  day  out，That same old voodoo follows me about，That same old pounding in my heart, whenever I think of you，Day in and day out，Day out - day in，I needn't tell you how my days begin。
<br><br>
卢璐：我有一个很，很美好的愿望，就是特别希望哪一天她能和她爸爸在一个舞台上演出，所以我在我第一次啊的时候她那时候才一岁多，我给她买了十几二十套服装，就想着她两岁多，三岁多，四岁多一直买到可能十岁，上台演出的那些服装，但是她从来没穿过，这是我特别大的一个遗憾。
<br><br>
刘欢：她在艺术上的这个认知度非常好，我觉得她有这个先天的条件，感悟力很强。
<br><br>
刘熠思：When  there  it  is，Day  in  day  out。<br><br>
解说：长达二十多天的全家旅行增进了一家人的情感，女儿刘熠思的善解人意和懂事也给刘欢夫妇带来的很多快乐。
<br><br>
刘熠思：把这个杏仁的皮给脱掉，然后脱掉皮以后就变成这个样子了，好香啊，我闻着好冲的香味，刚才她加的是有玫瑰水，但是我没有闻到玫瑰味，可是是很香的花味，只求她加的那个黄粉，我不知道是这边可能当地的某种香料还是什么东西，我也不知道，没听说过，不知道什么东西，然后呢我就把这些东西捏成那个形状，放到烤盘里面，放到烤箱以后呢就应该貌似就是这个样子了。
<br><br>
画中音：好，很好，非常好。
<br><br>
刘熠思：这个是我的吗？<br><br>

画中音：是的。<br><br>

刘熠思：所以我们昨天中午，昨天什么，下午的时候做的，今天中午过来取，现在打不开，一会等见到爸爸妈妈再打开，我觉得一定会很丑，所以还是别打开，终于拿回来了，我还没来得及看呢，我也没太敢看，因为我觉得我昨天捏的一定很难看，所以先事先说明一下啊，这个东西呢本身它就真的不是很好看。<br><br>

卢璐：很漂亮啊。<br><br>

刘熠思：都给我包好了啊。<br><br>

卢璐：包得真好。<br><br>

刘熠思：这个是我做的吗？已经面目全非了，我已经不认识这个东西了，反正。
<br><br>
刘欢：蓝的，红的。<br><br>

卢璐：那我们要尝一个吧，哪个是你的？面目全非的这个，这个肯定是你的，我们尝这个吧，好甜。
<br><br>
刘熠思：就是巨甜。<br><br>

卢璐：还有一股香皂味。<br><br>

刘熠思：跟你说，对吧，有香皂尾。<br><br>

卢璐：还真是。<br><br>

刘欢：谢谢<br><br>

卢璐：谢谢。<br><br>

画中音：她还行将来能上得厅堂，下得厨房。<br><br>

 
解说：银婚二十五年，他们之间如何应对争吵和分歧？
<br><br>
卢璐：看我特不顺眼的时候想过分手吗？
<br><br>
刘欢：没有吧。
<br><br>
解说：又共同经历了哪些？际遇起伏和病痛生死。
<br><br>
刘欢：那就赶快，赶快，赶快，赶快做手术。
<br><br>
卢璐：现在就让我死太早了，我就觉得太早了。
<br><br>
解说：《鲁豫有约》说出你的故事，听刘欢卢璐夫妇讲述二十五年银婚感悟。
<br><br>
卢璐：再不浪漫就老了。
<br><br>
刘欢：25年以前做梦都想不到这种事。
<br><br>
解说：刘欢和卢璐已经携手走过了二十五年，他们的家庭和睦而美满，但和所有家庭一样，他们同样会有分歧，会有争吵。
<br><br>
陈鲁豫：感情再好，再恩爱的夫妻说，比如生活很多很多年当中总会有多少多少次想着要分手，总是有多少多少次看对方简直就看不顺眼，到了简直就不行了，你们是不是也，也会经历过这样的时刻？任何夫妻都会经历这样的时刻。
<br><br>
卢璐：肯定有，哎你，你看我特不顺眼的时候想过分手吗？
<br><br>
刘欢：没有吧。
<br><br>
陈鲁豫：那你什么时候会看她特别不顺眼呢？
<br><br>
刘欢：没有，没有。
<br><br>
卢璐：唠叨呗。
<br><br>
刘欢：对她我就是，就是我刚才跟你说的这个，为什么后来接受这个，我不接受这个。
<br><br>
陈鲁豫：每天唠叨。
<br><br>
刘欢：那个，那造成那烦比这个还，我想，算了算了，我就，就这样吧，然后也，但是呢也都从来没有搞到那么极端的什么某种情况上去，我觉得这方面我还是比较能Hold得住，不会把事给弄得，就是不可收拾的啊，吵架这是正常的，这从来都是难免的。
<br><br>
陈鲁豫：你会吵架吗？
<br><br>
刘欢：我，我基本上不会，我就不吱声了。
<br><br>
陈鲁豫：对，我觉得。
<br><br>
卢璐：他喝了酒会，你是不是第二天就忘了可能好像喝完酒。
<br><br>
刘欢：那也不是吵架，那就是我一个让嚷嚷，那也就是。
<br><br>
卢璐：才不是呢，但男的和女的确实是不一样，我觉得这个唠叨不唠叨的事啊我觉得是双，双方面的，比如一件事情我说两句，你要是就做了，特别正确的事情他老不做，你想那肯定就会唠叨，但是呢我越唠叨他就越烦，我觉得自己有时候就是。
<br><br>
陈鲁豫：你不会动一点策略吗？你反着说。
<br><br>
卢璐：哎呦，我哄过，我什么办法都使过。
<br><br>
陈鲁豫：没用。
<br><br>
卢璐：没用，我知道对男人他们说嘛，男人你也得哄着，你还得供着，我都来过，软硬兼施都没用。
<br><br>
陈鲁豫：因为我也是女性我知道就我，我可以迁就你，我可以听你的，我也可以哄着你，但你也得来迁就我，哄着我呀。
<br><br>
卢璐：对呀，他不哄我。
<br><br>
陈鲁豫：他不哄你吗？
<br><br>
卢璐：你哄我吗？
<br><br>
刘欢：不知道，我反正我能做的情况就是。
<br><br>
卢璐：可能因为我比他大，他就不哄我。
<br><br>
刘欢：对，一起急了呢我呢就不说话了就完了，她就是这，咱这事得掰扯明白了啊，哪那么多事能掰扯明白，其实世界上好多事。
<br><br>
卢璐：你不是，你是所有的事都不说。
<br><br>
刘欢：没，没那么多非得弄得多明白的事啊，而且很多时候也没什么大不了的。
<br><br>
水均益：刘欢在生活当中，特别是在夫妻之间和家庭生活当中，我的观察他属于一个比较大大咧咧的，比如经常我看到比如我们在一块也好，在他家也好，或者在一块聚会也好，卢璐总是有一种感觉是在他边上叨叨跟他说，哎老刘你这个怎么着，然后刘欢总是一种比如说叼着一个烟斗，那时候还抽烟斗啊，啊，那，你看吧，就是那种，就有一搭无一搭，似乎你有时候觉得他都没在听，但是他心里有数。有的时候可能卢璐会有点，带有点责怪的口气说刘欢，哎老刘你这个事怎么怎么的，那刘欢呢这个最好的一个特点就是他不接茬，他不给你这个，这个发动战争的理由和借口，夫妻之间长久的相处时光中，不光会有幸福喜悦、浪漫温馨，自然也少不了烦恼无助，际遇起伏，甚至是病痛生死，就在刘欢为女儿陪读的2009年，一次偶然负伤不愈，他上网查询发现自己右腿患上股骨头缺血性坏死，但为了不影响丝丝的SAT考试，不让妻子担心，他瞒着身边的女儿和远在北京的卢璐咬牙坚持了三个月。
<br><br>
刘欢：我就想拖着，拖着，拖着但是后来太影响生活质量了，走路困难，天天拄着个拐棍，他们那时候还老笑我，说你这弄的像黑社会老大一样的，天天拿着个拐棍，但是后来我，后来就是就拿着拐棍呢也，也不行了，就是基本上拄着拐棍走，不能超过一百米，超过一百米就感觉腿拖在后边很难受，所以我就算了，下决心就换了。
<br><br>
卢璐：他那个腿不是上了一个人工关节吗，他不能提重物，所有我们去哪儿也好所有的大箱子再沉都是我来搬，有时候我会特别怕有时候去，比如说去纽约，旁边有老外，就会看着觉得特别不理解啊，我特别，我就让他走远一点，我怕别人会认为这个男的怎么不帮女的扛啊？但人家不知道嘛，我又没法跟人家解释，所以我想让他走远一点。
<br><br>
解说：2010年刘欢在北京成功进行了右腿髋关节置换术，手术后的刘欢身体恢复得非常不错，可是没想到，在两年之后妻子卢璐也和死神擦肩而过。
<br><br>
卢璐：我呢去年也突然出了一个差点，差点没离开他，就是当时出问题的时候刘欢也没告诉我女儿。
<br><br>
刘熠思：就那次是真，真正特别真切的体会到什么东西都有可能一瞬间就没有了。
<br><br>
卢璐：我是认为要告诉我女儿的，后来我自己告诉我女儿的，我觉得这么大一个事情一定要让我女儿知道，我们是一家人，应该一起来分担，我觉得我差点就见不着她了，怎么能不告诉她呢。
<br><br>
刘熠思：一开始是反正是哽咽，说不出来话，说不出来话，我就赶快问就怎么了，怎么了，然后她就是吞吞吐吐的给我告诉我，然后我在这边就已经是哭得就不行了，当然可能没太表现出来吧，就是还是忍着了，然后就吸吸鼻子什么的，我估计我妈可能现在她应该能猜到，但是她不一定知道，我当时是哭了的。
<br><br>
解说：2012年9月11日，刘欢夫妇按要求到医院进行体检复查，因为次日有课，刘欢复查完后回家备课，而卢璐因身负24小时心脏监测仪，不愿第二天再跑一趟医院，就没有随刘欢回家，独自在医院留观一夜，没想到这小懒一下却捡回一条命，因为就在第二天早上卢璐的前胸主动脉血管内壁突然破裂。
<br><br>
卢璐：我要是在任何地方他们说如果我在家或者在外面120来了，不知道我不能搬动，搬动了我如果胸腔出血半个小时以内我是救不过来的，当时已经疼得要死了，我就觉得我说我现在就让我死太早了，我就觉得太早了。
<br><br>
解说：开设并教授《西方音乐史》，二十六年从未耽误学生一堂课的刘欢在妻子生命最关键的时刻第一次向学校请了假。
<br><br>
刘欢：你就赶快，赶快，赶快，赶快做手术，因为那天还好，他们正好有一个特别好的一个主任医生在，因为那种出的问题她特别怕耽误时间，就是如果你拖了，就可能又会出现别的什么问题就不知道了，所以那时候真的没想别的，赶快，就是很忐忑，你就得等着，不知道是什么情况，当然他们那医术是很高明，他们也表现的很轻松告诉你，基本上会应该没问题，他很轻松的告诉你一些个最坏的可能性，我觉得这个是特别让人难过，就是你马上要做手术之前，因为医生总是这样，他要把最坏的可能性先告诉你，当然他讲得很轻松，然后他就去做手术了，我一个人在外面我天啊这个是，这个怎么过啊，就是所以这都是一种挑战，我觉得人很多事都要经过。
<br><br>
解说：在卢璐手术的第二天，刘欢就不得不忍痛告别妻子，如约赶赴上海参加连续三天的电视节目录制，没有人能在他脸上看到任何异样，他浑身散发出来的正能量不仅给学员，给观众也给现场的媒体朋友带去了深深的感动。
<br><br>
刘欢：我们希望我们共同努力，让我们中国的流行音乐丰富起来，让我们观众的耳朵听到各种不同的音乐，这我想是我们共同奋斗目标，也是Tia奋斗的目标。
<br><br>


Tia：我很骄傲有这么好的老师。
<br><br>
陈鲁豫：反正我看到你们我还是觉得挺感慨的，因为我生活中碰到很多的人，我发现如今生活中痛苦的人比，比幸福的人多得很多，好像你看身边的人都在情感当中纠结着，然后沉浮着，好像，像你们这样就是平静幸福生活的人真的不多，你说是为什么呢？
<br><br>
刘欢：可能就是人过得幸福不是因为得到的多，是因为想要的少。
<br><br>
陈鲁豫：你说一个长久的婚姻的秘诀是什么呢？还是没有秘诀？就是我们就幸运了，那宝押对了。
<br><br>
卢璐：我觉得就是幸运，缘分吧，用个好词。
<br><br>
陈鲁豫：缘分。
<br><br>
卢璐：就是，在特面前我不好意思说，借着镜头我也谢谢，谢谢刘欢，对，谢谢他，谢谢我女儿。
<br><br>
刘欢：一个承诺要努力非常使劲的去坚守的话这个承诺就无意义了，就是这个，这个承诺是你特别乐意去承诺的，这个承诺才有意义。
<br><br>
刘熠思：感恩你们一直对我这么好，一直爱我，一直保护我，一直关心我，反正就是希望你们，不用希望了，我肯定你们，你们这个爱情能一直走下去，金婚一定是能走到那的，健健康康的，然后快快乐乐的，两个人好好的过日子，就够了。
<br><br>
