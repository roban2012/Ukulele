Copying Beethoven is a 2006 dramatic film released by Metro Goldwyn Mayer and directed by Agnieszka Holland which gives a fictional take on the triumphs and heartaches of Ludwig van Beethoven's last years. A fictionalized version of the last three years of Ludwig van Beethoven's life, beginning with the composition of the Ninth Symphony. It is set in 1824 as Beethoven (Ed Harris) is finishing his new symphony. He is plagued by deafness, loneliness and personal trauma. A fictional character, a new copyist, Anna Holtz (Diane Kruger) is engaged to help the composer finish preparing the score for the first performance. Anna is a young conservatory student and aspiring composer. Her understanding of his work is such that she corrects mistakes he has made, while her personality opens a door into his private world. Beethoven is initially skeptical, but slowly comes to trust Anna's assistance and eventually grows fond of her. By the time the piece is performed, her presence is a necessity and she helps him conduct the premiere from a spot hidden amongst the orchestra.
After the premiere, they collaborate and become closer. His eccentricities become more and more troublesome, but Anna continues to provide companionship. She eventually transcribes his compositions as he simply talks her through them.

剧情<br><br>
1824年，音乐大师贝多芬(艾德 哈里斯饰)正在赶制自己的新作《第九交响曲》，在乐章完成的最后阶段，他的御用抄谱员施莱默突然病入膏肓，将要不久于人世。为了让贝多芬的杰作如期上演，施莱默向维也纳音乐学院求助，希望能有位高才生来接替自己的位置。不久，23岁的才女安娜(黛安 克鲁格饰)出现在施莱默的面前，施莱默告诫安娜，贝多芬是个暴君，和他一起工组需要有足够的心理准备和耐心，并将没抄写完的乐谱交给了安娜。<br><br>
安娜乐于为这位脾气暴躁的狂人抄写乐谱，而作为音乐天才，安娜也不安于抄谱员的工作，她要让贝多芬品评自己的作品。当安娜将完成的《第九交响曲》交给贝多芬时，还告诉他替他修改了错误。在日复一日的接触中，贝多芬对安娜的态度由最初的怀疑逐渐转变成信任和依赖。<br><br>
虽然贝多芬在人前风光无限，但生活中也有难言之隐。他非常宠爱侄子卡尔(乔 安德森饰)，期望他能出落成优秀的钢琴家，但卡尔偏偏好逸恶劳、嗜赌成性，甚至窃取叔叔的钱财。尽管《第九交响曲》的首演非常成功，但贝多芬却因侄子倒卖掉门票而沮丧不已。关键时刻，安娜总能在贝多芬的身边给予抚慰和帮助，贝多芬开始离不开安娜，甚至与安娜的男友马丁(马修 古迪饰)争风吃醋。分分合合之间，贝多芬与安娜之间微妙的关系开始让两人的生活天翻地覆……<br><br>
本片讲述了“音乐巨人”贝多芬丧失听力后的夕阳韵事，旨在披露《命运》交响曲背后不为人知的美丽乐章。身心承受着莫大痛苦而倍感孤独的天才，与立志成为音乐家的作曲助理日久生情。最终，爱的力量让贝多芬再次体味久违的幸福，为其渐趋褪色的生命重新涂上希望的色彩。<br><br>Martin Walser: Ein liebender Mann<br><br>

现代音乐教育方法源自德语区的Dalcroze、Kodaly和Orff。Carl Orff（1895 1982）音乐风格冷峻、古朴、简洁，力主强调节奏的支配地位。Orff认为：表达（Expression）自己是人类的本能欲望。表达通过语言（文学数学）、音乐（含乐器演奏歌唱）、舞蹈及造型艺术等形式自然地发生。如同语言，这是人原本固有的能力。音乐教育的首要任务，就是不断地启发和提升这种本能的表现力，而表现得好不好则不是追求的最终目标。1、听力训练结合“人体乐器”和肢体语言（Flamenco舞蹈、口技、太极及疯狂英语），强化潜意识乐感。2、从朗诵入手，提取“节奏基石”，由诗而歌。3、节奏律动训练：拍手击鼓、敲击琴键、口哨竖笛，熟能生巧。4、演奏配合：组成打击乐器/Ukulele乐队，团队协作（编钟演奏/小星星/自由泳）。5、学生们参与即兴创作并演奏自己设计的音乐，但不用乐谱。<br><br>
音乐教育：表达思想或感情；自尊自控；分享信任；传递激情；配合准确同步；坚持/熟能生巧；梦幻想象力。<br><br>

《复制贝多芬》（英语：Copying Beethoven），关于乐圣贝多芬的虚构传记电影，描写他晚年创作《第九交响曲》时的遭遇。本片由波兰导演安格妮兹卡 贺兰执导，两位编剧兼任制片，2006年11月10日由米高梅公司发行上映，于2007年4月30日发行DVD。1824年，乐圣贝多芬正在赶工完成新作。这些年来，他孤家寡人，饱受感情创伤，耳疾折磨，距离上次创作出受众人激赏的作品已有年月[1]。在作品完成的最后阶段，贝多芬的御用抄谱员不幸病入膏肓，缺少深通乐理的抄谱员，演奏时乐团势将无谱可奏。安娜是音乐学院推荐的女抄谱员，胸怀大志，希望借由这次机会让贝多芬品评她的创作。脾性狂躁的贝多芬起初怀疑女子能否有才担此大任，在随后的相处中，他不只慢慢依赖安娜的帮助，还对安娜产生好感，到最后，安娜成为贝多芬生命中不可忽视的存在，开启了他心底的那扇门窗。剧中的重头戏，莫过于长达10分钟的《第九交响曲》首演片段。1824年5月7日《第九交响曲》配合《庄严弥撒》在维也纳的康顿剧院（Kartnerthor Theater）演出，获得空前成功。剧组在匈牙利的考托纳剧院模拟这幕场景，乐团由当地的凯奇凯梅特交响乐团和合唱团支援演出，初学乍练的哈里斯和乐团表演时相当专心，“在拍摄终曲前的某个段落，导演已经喊卡，但是我们却停不下来，我一直指挥，交响乐团也持续演奏，直到结束。整座剧院后来爆出如雷掌声，当时真的很令我心满意足。”，拍摄时剧院内部摆了600支蜡烛，需要8名“蜡烛管理员”在每个镜头间快速点燃或熄灭蜡烛。<br><br>
拍摄现场乐团虽然实际演奏，但是电影里的音乐其实是使用了1996年伯纳德 海廷克指挥知名的阿姆斯特丹皇家大会堂管弦乐团（Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra）的福茂（Decca）录音版本。<br><br>

《欢乐颂》又称《快乐颂》（德文：Ode An die Freude），是在1785年由德国诗人席勒所写的诗歌。贝多芬为之谱曲，成为他的第九交响曲第四乐章的主要部份，包含四独立声部、合唱、乐团。这由贝多芬所谱曲的音乐（不包含文字）以欧洲之歌为名成为现今欧洲联盟盟歌、欧洲委员会会歌，亦曾被用作罗德西亚1974 1979年国歌《扬起罗德西亚的声音》的旋律。席勒的An die Freude最早创作于1785年，并收录于隔年出版的Thalia中。
<br><br>
席勒于1803年对An die Freude进行修改，删减了部分词句，贝多芬在第九号交响曲第四乐章中所使用的歌词，便是以席勒1803年版本的An die Freude为基础。<br><br>

  Herr Schlemmer?   SCHLEMMER: Oh, I have to pee, my dear. 	<br><br>
I'm afraid there is a mistake. 	<br><br>
I've come from the conservatory. I received this note. 	<br><br>
How did you get this? 	<br><br>
You sent it to Dr. Rauch requesting his brightest composition student. 	<br><br>
He was kind enough to send me. 	<br><br>
You said you needed a copyist as a matter of great urgency. 	<br><br>
But... But you're a woman. 	<br><br>
  Yes, sir.   Oh, God. Help me up, please. 	<br><br>
(GROANING) 	<br><br>
I used to be a strong man. I hunted boar in the forest. 	<br><br>
Now this is all that's left. 	<br><br>
Now, you must go back to Rauch. Tell him to send someone else. 	<br><br>
But you insisted on his best student. 	<br><br>
And forgive me, Herr Schlemmer, 	<br><br>
I may be a woman but I am the best student. 	<br><br>
I'm certainly capable of any copying tasks you may have. 	<br><br>
Do you know why you're here? 	<br><br>
Do you know whom we're talking about? 	<br><br>
No, Dr. Rauch didn't explain. 	<br><br>
  The Beast.   The Beast? 	<br><br>
Beethoven. 	<br><br>
They're premiering his Ninth Symphony and the parts are not ready. 	<br><br>
  What remains to be done?   The chorale. 	<br><br>
Can you imagine? A chorale in a symphony? 	<br><br>
How many voices? 	<br><br>
Four soloists and a chorus, and they don't sing until the end. 	<br><br>
They just stand there waiting, hundreds of them, for an hour. 	<br><br>
  He's utterly losing his mind.   When is the premiere? 	<br><br>
Four days time. 	<br><br>
This cancer is a gift from God. Death will be a vacation. 	<br><br>
Herr Schlemmer, from what I understand, there is really no time to waste. 	<br><br>
The premiere is Sunday, you have no copyist. 	<br><br>
I really should get to work right away. 	<br><br>
On my desk. That pile. That's part of the chorale. 	<br><br>
This is his handwriting? This... 	<br><br>
  BEETHOVEN: Schlemmer?   Oh, my God, it's him! 	<br><br>
Get away, get away. 	<br><br>
BEETHOVEN: Schlemmer, where are you? What are you doing? 	<br><br>
I'm dying, Maestro. 	<br><br>
And I am on the cross! God in heaven, why am I abused this way? 	<br><br>

I'll destroy you! 	<br><br>
(DOOR SLAMS SHUT) 	<br><br>
ANNA: Herr Schlemmer? SCHLEMMER: I will go. 	<br><br>
  You're in no condition.   I must go. 	<br><br>
  Please, calm yourself. I'll go.   Oh, yes, you go. 	<br><br>
That makes much more sense. I'll stay here. 	<br><br>
But first, we must attend to this. He will be expecting this. 	<br><br>
(CHORAL MUSIC PLA YING) 	<br><br>
(PIANO PLAYING) 	<br><br>
Good afternoon. I'm looking for Ludwig van Beethoven. 	<br><br>
(BEETHOVEN SINGING) 	<br><br>
He can't hear you. He's deaf, you know. Just go in. 	<br><br>
Thank you. 	<br><br>
(BEETHOVEN CONTINUES SINGING) 	<br><br>
  Your corrected copy, Maestro.   My dear girl, what is it? 	<br><br>
What? 	<br><br>
The corrected copy that you asked of Herr Schlemmer this morning. 	<br><br>
Copy? 	<br><br>
That you asked of Herr Schlemmer this morning. 	<br><br>
Oh, yeah. Poor Schlemmer. 	<br><br>
I do hope he's coming. I owe him an apology. 	<br><br>
No, I'm afraid he is too ill. He sent me. 	<br><br>
Too ill, you say? Well, thank you. 	<br><br>
I'm working, as you see, as you no doubt heard. 	<br><br>
A hood helps to concentrate the sound. The vibrations, I feel the vibrations. 	<br><br>
Here, I want you to take these to Schlemmer. 	<br><br>
Tell him that I must have someone to work with me here. 	<br><br>
That is why he sent me, Maestro, to work with you. 	<br><br>
What? 	<br><br>
(LOUDLY) I am the one he sent to work with you. 	<br><br>
(LAUGHING) Mercy. 	<br><br>
  You old letch. He sent you, did he?   Yes. 	<br><br>
Now, you go back, my sweet girl. 	<br><br>
Tell Schlemmer I'm going out for my dinner, and when I get back, I expect a copyist to be here. 	<br><br>
I told you, that is why I am here. 	<br><br>
  What?   That is why I'm here, Maestro. 	<br><br>
You're serious, aren't you? 	<br><br>
If you will look at the pages I copied for you this morning, 	<br><br>
  you will see that I am fully qualified to...   How could he do this to me? 	<br><br>
I'm not a well man. I've rheumatism, gout, water on the lungs. 	<br><br>
You were saying something. 	<br><br>
Never speak to me when my back is turned. 	<br><br>
What were you saying? 	<br><br>
I was asking you to read the pages I copied. 	<br><br>
Read the pages. All right, I'll do that. I'll read the pages. 	<br><br>
(HUMMING) 	<br><br>
Nice, very good. 	<br><br>
(EX CLAIMING) 	<br><br>
What's this? 	<br><br>
Right before the choir comes in, B major, D major. 	<br><br>
You have it in B minor. 	<br><br>
I wrote it in B major. Why did you change it? 	<br><br>
  I didn't change it.   What? 	<br><br>
(LOUDLY) I didn't change it. I corrected it. 	<br><br>
Corrected it? You corrected it? 	<br><br>
Yes, I knew you didn't intend to keep it in B major. 	<br><br>
Really? 	<br><br>
Well, the Italians would keep it in B major. 	<br><br>
Rossini would keep it in the major, Cherubini would keep it in the major. 	<br><br>
But you wouldn't. 	<br><br>
You would change it just for a moment, 	<br><br>
to build the suspense before the explosion. 	<br><br>
If you will permit me... 	<br><br>
ANNA: That's neither Rossini or Cherubini. That's Beethoven. 	<br><br>
You're saying that I accidentally miswrote it? 	<br><br>
No, Maestro. I think you did it deliberately. 	<br><br>
  I think it was a trap.   A track? 	<br><br>
  A trap.   A trap? 	<br><br>
  To test Herr Schlemmer.   Why on earth would I test Schlemmer? 	<br><br>
  To see if he truly understood.   Understood what? 	<br><br>
  Your soul.   My soul? 	<br><br>
  You think it works in the minor?   Am I wrong? 	<br><br>
You approve of what I've done? 	<br><br>
I think it's brilliant. I think it's all wonderful. 	<br><br>
  You like it?   Very, very much. 	<br><br>
  How old are you, my dear?   Twenty three. 	<br><br>
Twenty three years old. 	<br><br>
I can just imagine you at the creation, with your two decades of experience, saying to the Almighty, 	<br><br>
"I think you've done a brilliant job with the world. 
I especially like South America. Beautiful shape. "	<br><br>
"That wonderful bulge and the slender taper. 
The Straits of Magellan, lovely little touch. "	<br><br>
"Africa, on the other hand, bit wide for my taste. 
And Asia is entirely out of proportion. "	<br><br>
I'm afraid, Herr Godhead, you'll have to do it all over. 	<br><br>
I cannot tell you how much it means to me to know that you approve of my work. 	<br><br>
  What are you doing?   Nothing. 	<br><br>
You must look at me when you speak. 	<br><br>
  What is your name?   Anna. Anna Holtz. 	<br><br>
Anna Holtz. 	<br><br>
Well, Anna Holtz, I'm going to Krenski's tavern for my dinner. 	<br><br>
We can work when I get back. 	<br><br>
Meanwhile, start on these. 	<br><br>
You may put your things over here. 	<br><br>
Please excuse the condition of my rooms. I'm a bachelor, you know, without a wife. 	<br><br>
What an existence. 	<br><br>
Thank God for my nephew Karl. He's my whole life, yes. My whole life. 	<br><br>
  Have you eaten?   No. 	<br><br>
I'll bring you something. Do you like trout? 	<br><br>
  Thank you.   Very good. 	<br><br>
I'm a very difficult person, Anna Holtz, but I take comfort in the fact that God made me that way. 	<br><br>
(ANNA READING) 	<br><br>
(SCREAMS) 	<br><br>
(GRUNTING) 	<br><br>
(LAUGHING) 	<br><br>
  Krenski, another.   Maestro... 	<br><br>
  Come on, I've earned it.   It's getting late, Louis. 	<br><br>
  What?   It's late. Shouldn't you be working? 	<br><br>
I can't go home. There's a woman in my apartment. 	<br><br>
  Young woman?   Twenty three. 	<br><br>
If I had a 23 year old girl waiting in my apartment, I'd never leave. 	<br><br>
MAGDA: Will I be seeing you later tonight, Maestro? 	<br><br>
  Thank you.   Not tonight, Magda. 	<br><br>
He's already got a fish in the fire. 	<br><br>
Yeah, how about you, Rudy? 	<br><br>
Oh, Magda, I haven't had a hard on since he could hear. 	<br><br>
What? 	<br><br>
Rudy... 	<br><br>
This is serious. She wants to work with me. 	<br><br>
  Copy my work.   So let her. 	<br><br>
Yes, well, it's not just that. She changed something I wrote. 	<br><br>
You understand? She did what I should have done. 	<br><br>
  Well, that's a good thing, isn't it?   It's frightening. How did she know? 	<br><br>
This new symphony, it's my farewell. 	<br><br>
  You're not that sick.   No, no, no, no. 	<br><br>
My farewell to music as I've always known it, as I've always written it. 	<br><br>
You've been talking about that for years, Louis. 	<br><br>
I'm starting a new chapter in my life. 	<br><br>
New forms, a new language. 	<br><br>
And now this woman is sent to me at this very moment. 	<br><br>
What if she was sent by him? 	<br><br>
  Women are usually sent by the other one.   Well, suppose it's a sign? 	<br><br>
  A sign for what, Louis?   That it's time. 	<br><br>
  A time for what?   A time for me to join with him. 	<br><br>
Well, if it's true and she was sent by him, and she's waiting in your apartment, you shouldn't be sitting here drinking, should you? 	<br><br>
(DOG BARKING) 	<br><br>
(HUMMING) 	<br><br>
Maestro? 	<br><br>
What are you doing here? Why aren't you upstairs? 	<br><br>
There are rats in your room. Big rats. 	<br><br>
Yes, they keep away the cats. I hate cats. 	<br><br>
  Why?   They don't make any noise. 	<br><br>
How long have you been here? 	<br><br>
  Two hours, maybe.   Oh, goodness. 	<br><br>
We won't work tonight. You come back in the morning. 	<br><br>
  I'll get you a cab. You go home now.   Thank you. 	<br><br>
  Where do you live?   The Convent of the Sacred Heart. 	<br><br>
(LOUDLY) The Convent of the Sacred Heart. 	<br><br>
Convent? You live in a convent with nuns? 	<br><br>
  Yes.   They're worse than cats. 	<br><br>
The mother superior is my great aunt. 	<br><br>
It was the only way my father would let me come to Vienna to study. 	<br><br>
To study? What do you study? 	<br><br>
  Composition.   Oh, my God. 	<br><br>
A woman composer. 	<br><br>
There have been many women composers. 	<br><br>
Like a dog walking on its hind legs. 	<br><br>
It's never done well, but you're surprised it's done at all. 	<br><br>
Driver! 	<br><br>
  Take her to the Sacred Heart.   Yes, sir. 	<br><br>
I almost forgot. Your trout. 	<br><br>
  Come tomorrow. Early.   ANNA: Thank you. 	<br><br>
(DRIVER URGING HORSE) 	<br><br>
  You are aware of the time, Anna?   I'm sorry, Mother. 	<br><br>
  But I have a job.   A job? 	<br><br>
Yes, I'm working with Beethoven. 	<br><br>
Beethoven, the black Catholic? He was nearly excommunicated. 	<br><br>
Anna, I really don't think this is wise. 	<br><br>
Excuse me, Mother, but I can learn a great deal from him. 	<br><br>
About what? Drunkenness, profanity, heresy? 	<br><br>
How long do you intend to continue with this job? 	<br><br>
  Until the premiere of his new symphony.   I see. 	<br><br>
Your young man was here today. I sent him away again. 	<br><br>
Anna, your father has entrusted me with your well being, and I take that role very seriously. 	<br><br>
I understand, but I am not a child. I came to Vienna with a purpose. 	<br><br>
Purposes can change. I came here to study with Salieri when he was composer to the emperor's court. 	<br><br>
I wanted to sing with the Paris Opera. 	<br><br>
I know what it is to be a girl who has dreams. 	<br><br>
Then perhaps you can find it in your heart to respect mine. 	<br><br>
I'm going to trust you, Anna, but remember, dreams can be wonderful, they can also be dangerous. 	<br><br>
Sometimes all the more wonderful because of the danger. 	<br><br>
Thank you. Good night. 	<br><br>
(DOOR SHUTS) 	<br><br>
Anna? 	<br><br>
ANNA: (WHISPERING) Martin, are you crazy? 	<br><br>
(PANTING) Yes. This is the twelfth window I've tried, and I must say, there are some very attractive nuns in this convent. 	<br><br>
I couldn't wait to tell you. 	<br><br>
Anna, I've been invited to submit my design for the competition. 	<br><br>
  The Archduke's competition?   Yes. 	<br><br>
  And if I win, it will make my career...   Martin! 	<br><br>
  I have some news, too.   What? 	<br><br>
Can you make it fast? I can't hang on much longer. 	<br><br>
  I'm copying Beethoven.   Beethoven... 	<br><br>
(GASPS) 	<br><br>

All right. 	<br><br>
  Excuse me, Herr Schlemmer.   Now, that was Beethoven. 	<br><br>
Was Beethoven. 	<br><br>
He wrote it for a young woman, you know. A young woman named Elise. 	<br><br>
You see, he was a romantic, and then something changed. 	<br><br>
  His deafness?   No, more than that. 	<br><br>
It's as if his soul has gone deaf. 	<br><br>
He doesn't listen to the public anymore. 	<br><br>
The Last Piano Sonatas. Have you heard them? 	<br><br>
What is this? You tell me, what is this? 	<br><br>
Who does he write for nowadays? It's certainly not for money. 	<br><br>
I'm lucky if I can get anyone to pay for his works. 	<br><br>
So how am I going to pay for you? 	<br><br>
I don't mind, Herr Schlemmer. Really. 	<br><br>
I see this as an opportunity sent from God. 	<br><br>
To make restitution for your sins? 	<br><br>
  To show him my work.   Promise you won't do that. 	<br><br>
He'll tear you to pieces. 	<br><br>
Did you hear what he said to Rossini, my most popular composer? 	<br><br>
  What if I have talent?   Please. 	<br><br>
Excuse me, my dear, but don't show him anything, not before the premiere. Promise me that much. 	<br><br>
I'm off to his apartment now. 	<br><br>
Tell him he must finish today. Don't tell him I said that. You tell him. 	<br><br>
It may be that he likes you. 	<br><br>
They're rehearsing the first three movements now, and he insists on conducting. 	<br><br>
What's he going to do? Lip read? 	<br><br>
  He can't hear the orchestra?   Oh, the last time he conducted them, he threw them off so badly they had to start all over again twice. 	<br><br>
Please, try to convince him not to conduct. 	<br><br>

KARL: A little higher, please. 	<br><br>
You won't last long. They never do. 	<br><br>
Did you empty out the piss pots? Good girl. 	<br><br>
He's a filthy old bastard, isn't he? 	<br><br>
I must say, you're the prettiest one he's had. 	<br><br>
  You should really come and work for me.   Who are you? 	<br><br>
I'm Karl van Beethoven, the nephew. 	<br><br>
  You're the one who...   Who what? Ruined his life? 	<br><br>
Made it impossible for him to compose for years? 	<br><br>
The ungrateful little brat who only borrows money? 	<br><br>
Yes, that's me. 	<br><br>
I was going to say, the one he dotes on. 	<br><br>
KARL: Dotes on? Yes, in his dotage. 	<br><br>
  How long have you been working for him?   Since last night. 	<br><br>
(TSKING) 	<br><br>
It's like that. 	<br><br>
He usually chooses the more mature, developed kind. 	<br><br>
(GROANS) 	<br><br>
Since I started this job, I've been mistaken for a nurse, a maid and now a prostitute! 	<br><br>
  No more!   Jesus, then what the hell are you? 	<br><br>
  I'm his copyist.   Copyist? 	<br><br>
  Yes.   Then why are you cleaning? 	<br><br>
Because I can't work under these conditions, 	<br><br>
  and I doubt that he can.   Are you joking? He lives this way. 	<br><br>
  Yes, and you let him.   Let him? 	<br><br>
You can't stop him from doing anything. He's a force of nature. 	<br><br>
Just ask my poor mother. For Christ's sake, ask me. 	<br><br>
Trying to force me to become a pianist, like him. 	<br><br>
  What's wrong with being a pianist?   What's... I have no talent. 	<br><br>
But still he thunders on. He tears down everything in his path. 	<br><br>
He destroys anyone he meets with his monumental ego. 	<br><br>
Oh, I am Ludwig van Beethoven, and you, you are nothing. 	<br><br>
At least not by the time he's done with you. 	<br><br>
  I will wait for your uncle outside.   No, no, no. I'm sorry, I'll go. 	<br><br>
It is not my place to make you leave this apartment. 	<br><br>
Miss... Holtz. 	<br><br>
I'm not what everybody says about me, Miss Holtz. 	<br><br>
He's trying to destroy my mother. 	<br><br>
I mean, for years he's kept me from her so that he could, well, possess me. 	<br><br>
Because he loves you. 	<br><br>
Yes, but I can't bear it. 	<br><br>
Everybody is used to being despised by him. 	<br><br>
Can you imagine what it's like to be the only one who is loved by him? 	<br><br>
(DOOR OPENS) 	<br><br>
I see you two have met. 	<br><br>
My nephew Karl. Isn't he fine? 	<br><br>
And you should hear him play the piano, Anna Holtz. 	<br><br>
He's a Beethoven, all right. Play something for her. 	<br><br>
Not now, Uncle, please. 	<br><br>
You have to get over that shyness if you want to go on stage. 	<br><br>
I don't want to go on stage. 	<br><br>
You should have been with me this morning. 	<br><br>
That would have braced you up. 	<br><br>
There's nothing like the rehearsal of a new work to get the musical juices flowing. 	<br><br>
Look, Anna Holtz, I finished. 	<br><br>
All your hard work inspired me. You must be an angel, a muse. 	<br><br>
Herr Schlemmer will be delighted. 	<br><br>
Schlemmer. I've arranged for Krenski to send him some pickled carp. 	<br><br>
That will put him back in the pink. 	<br><br>
  He's got cancer.   Shall we celebrate? 	<br><br>
Let's go up to the lake to Kahlenberg for lunch. 	<br><br>
ANNA: I must copy these for tomorrow's rehearsal. 	<br><br>
  Well, you then, Karl. Come with me.   I'm a bit short this month, Uncle. 	<br><br>
  What?   I say, I'm a bit short. 	<br><br>
Oh, nonsense. You're taller than I. 	<br><br>
That was a joke, Anna Holtz. A family joke. We have lots of good jokes in our family. 	<br><br>
Don't worry, Karl. I'll pay for everything. My treat. 	<br><br>
Well, actually, I'm very short this month. 	<br><br>
Oh, well, yes. 	<br><br>
Where's my... 	<br><br>
Shit. 	<br><br>
The cleaning woman, she's stealing from me. I know it. 	<br><br>
  Well, will 20 do?   Well... 	<br><br>
Here, 30, then. 	<br><br>
  You'll have supper with me tonight?   Well, I've promised some friends that... 	<br><br>
I'm the greatest friend you have in the world, Karl. 	<br><br>
  I'll try.   Karl. 	<br><br>
Kiss me. 	<br><br>
(DOOR CLOSES) 	<br><br>
He won't come. 	<br><br>
Went to gamble with his friends. 	<br><br>
That's why he wanted the money. 	<br><br>
What do you think of my nephew? 	<br><br>
I think he's confused and unhappy. 	<br><br>
He's my blood. 	<br><br>
  Are you unhappy?   I'm not confused. 	<br><br>
You shouldn't ask me such things, Anna Holtz. 	<br><br>
Don't say such things to me. 	<br><br>
You don't have the right. You haven't earned it. 	<br><br>
  I apologize, Maestro.   Did you speak? 	<br><br>
You're doing it again. I can't see your face. 	<br><br>
What did you say? I suppose you apologized. 	<br><br>
  Yes, Maestro.   Well, don't apologize when I attack you! 	<br><br>
Fight back! 	<br><br>
I can't stand people who whimper and simper and apologize! 	<br><br>
Well, you do it all the time! 	<br><br>
You abuse people, you insult them, and then you send them a pickled carp! 	<br><br>
That's true. 	<br><br>
That's better. 	<br><br>
Did he... 	<br><br>
Did he say anything about me? 	<br><br>
He said you wanted him to be a pianist, and he has no talent. 	<br><br>
I'll be the judge of that. What better judge than I? 	<br><br>
I've given Karl every advantage. The best teachers. Me, for God's sake. 	<br><br>
The boy has talent. It just has to be brought out. 	<br><br>
  Forced out?   (SHOUTING) What? 	<br><br>
  I was just...   What? 	<br><br>
I was just wondering if you can force someone to be an artist. 	<br><br>
Go back to work. 	<br><br>

(MAN SHOUTING) 	<br><br>

  Of course, Maestro.   And which is your favorite? 	<br><br>
The Waldstein? The Appassionata? 	<br><br>
Oh, I know. I know. 	<br><br>
The Moonlight. 	<br><br>
(BEETHOVEN LAUGHING) 	<br><br>
I can only stay a moment. I have to take these to Schlemmer's. 	<br><br>
  Oh, stay longer.   I can't. I... 	<br><br>
Besides, should the nuns find out... 	<br><br>
The nuns, the nuns. I'm going to break you out of that place. It's a prison. 	<br><br>
  Let me see it. Show it to me.   Show you what? 	<br><br>
  The bridge, you blockhead.   All right, all right. 	<br><br>
  MARTIN: What do you think?   It's amazing. 	<br><br>
A year's work. Every day, every night, every spare moment. 	<br><br>
Now all I have to do is build the model. 	<br><br>
Anna, if I win, they're going to build it across the Danube. My bridge. 	<br><br>
The Martin Bauer Bridge. 	<br><br>
Don't be silly. They'll name it after the Archduke. 	<br><br>
Archdukes come and go. Technology lasts forever. 	<br><br>
Beethoven wouldn't agree. He always says... 	<br><br>
Beethoven! Beethoven! Beethoven is an old hypocrite. 	<br><br>
He claims to be one of the people, but he lives off the rich. 	<br><br>
He fawns on the nobility. 	<br><br>
The Archduke, that prissy Russian count. 	<br><br>
(SIGHS) 	<br><br>
I wish you weren't working for him. 	<br><br>
I don't work for him. I work with him. 	<br><br>
Excuse me, Maestro. 	<br><br>
I thought it would be the greatest privilege in the world. 	<br><br>
And it is. 	<br><br>
  It's just that...   That what? 	<br><br>
He's a brute. He's filthy rude. 	<br><br>
He was lovely with me until he found out I was to be his copyist and then... 	<br><br>
And then what? 	<br><br>
He mooned me. 	<br><br>
He did... For God's sake, Anna, you have to get out of there! 	<br><br>
  But I want to show him my work.   Why? 	<br><br>
  Because it's a great opportunity.   Show it to him and get out. 	<br><br>
After the premiere. It's Sunday. Will you come? 	<br><br>
Two hours of Beethoven's music. 	<br><br>
Anna, nobody listens to this stuff anymore. 	<br><br>
This is the new music. This is the future. 	<br><br>
Very well, then. Don't come. I have to go now. 	<br><br>
To spend an evening with you, I would even listen to Beethoven. 	<br><br>
(BIRDS CHIRPING) 	<br><br>
(SIGHS) 	<br><br>
Good day, ma'am. 	<br><br>
Glorious, isn't it? 	<br><br>
The quiet. 	<br><br>
He's been out all day, since before dawn. 	<br><br>
Walks in the woods, you know, out in Kahlenberg. 	<br><br>
I have no windows. 	<br><br>
This is the only chance I get to open my door. 	<br><br>
That must be terrible, to be shut in all the time. 	<br><br>
I live for these moments, these peaceful hours. 	<br><br>
  Excuse me, but why don't you move?   Move? 	<br><br>
I am the next door neighbor of Ludwig van Beethoven. 	<br><br>
I hear all the pieces before anyone, before they're premiered. 	<br><br>
The whole of Vienna envies me. I've been with him since the 7th. 	<br><br>
(HUMMING) 	<br><br>
Wonderful stuff. 	<br><br>
The new one's coming along, isn't it? 	<br><br>
  Very well, thank you.   Keep him at it. 	<br><br>
I will. 	<br><br>
  Excuse me!   Christ. 	<br><br>
What are you doing? 	<br><br>
You're the one stealing from him, aren't you? 	<br><br>
  It's not stealing.   What is it, then? 	<br><br>
It's what he owes me. 	<br><br>
He's trying to arrange a recital for me. 	<br><br>
Do you understand? 	<br><br>
I don't want to play the goddamn piano. 	<br><br>
  Put back the money.   No, I can't. 	<br><br>
I have debts, debts I owe to very dangerous people. 	<br><br>
I mean, you have no idea. You're just a girl. Sheltered. 	<br><br>
Vienna is not a healthy place. 	<br><br>
You know, they say it's the center of culture, of civilization... 	<br><br>
Karl, give me the money. I'll put it back for you. 	<br><br>
  I can't.   Give me the money! 	<br><br>
I'm not a bad person, Miss Holtz. 	<br><br>
I just can't stop, and I need this money now. 	<br><br>
Oh, my God. He's coming. 	<br><br>
Karl! 	<br><br>
Karl! 	<br><br>
KARL: Uncle. 	<br><br>
BEETHOVEN: Good morning, Karl. Good morning. 	<br><br>
I'm late. 	<br><br>
  I've set the recital a week from Tuesday.   Okay. 	<br><br>
(HORSE NEIGHING) 	<br><br>
Anna Holtz, isn't life a beautiful thing? 	<br><br>
I was walking out at Kahlenberg. Do you ever go there? 	<br><br>
Nature. Man lives for nature. 	<br><br>
If you ever really want to compose, you must take rooms at Kahlenberg. 	<br><br>
I saw Karl. I met him on the stairs. 	<br><br>
Yes. 	<br><br>
Did he tell you? I've arranged a recital for him. He's very excited. 	<br><br>
Maestro. 	<br><br>
  He doesn't want to do the recital.   What? 	<br><br>
  He doesn't want to do the recital.   Nonsense. He said that to you? 	<br><br>
I just saw him. He said nothing of the kind. He didn't come here for that? 	<br><br>
No. He came here for money. 	<br><br>
Money? He didn't ask me for any money. 	<br><br>
Are you saying that he stole from me, that he came here to take my money? 	<br><br>
It's the cleaning woman. I've been meaning to sack her for weeks. 	<br><br>
Karl, a thief? Why would you say such a thing? 	<br><br>
Because I know that you love him. 	<br><br>
Love? And what would a girl your age understand about love? 	<br><br>
My God, you're in love, aren't you? Who? Let me guess. 	<br><br>
Your professor of counterpoint. 	<br><br>
Young, good looking, frilly shirted, fifth rate Rossini. 	<br><br>
  He's an engineer.   Engineer? 	<br><br>
Yes. He's designing a bridge for the Archduke's competition. 	<br><br>
One of our men of steel. One of our new iron men. 	<br><br>
  Martin is an artist.   Martin? Well... 	<br><br>
I'm very aware of Martin's kind of artists. They're slide rules without souls. 	<br><br>
You shouldn't be his lover, you should be his enemy. 	<br><br>
I'm not his lover. 	<br><br>
So, that's why you came to Vienna? To chase a man. 	<br><br>
I came to Vienna because God wishes me to be a composer. 	<br><br>
Well, then, he made a serious mistake in making you a woman. 	<br><br>
You should not talk about God that way. 	<br><br>
I assure you, Anna Holtz, the Almighty and I understand each other perfectly. 	<br><br>
We're like two bears in one den. 	<br><br>
We growl and snarl and claw at one another. 	<br><br>
Sleep at each other's backs. 	<br><br>
No one dares come near us. 	<br><br>
That sounds like a very Ionely religion. 	<br><br>
Loneliness is my religion. 	<br><br>
Why aren't you working? The premiere is tomorrow night. 	<br><br>
(SIGHING) 	<br><br>
Do you think I ought to cancel Karl's recital? 	<br><br>
  Yes, Maestro.   He wants to join the Army, you know? 	<br><br>
Abandon music, become a cavalryman. He always loved horses. 	<br><br>
Perhaps that would be for the best. 	<br><br>
Yes, perhaps. 	<br><br>
Perhaps. 	<br><br>
Why are you so frank with me, Anna Holtz? 	<br><br>
Because I esteem you as one of the greatest... 	<br><br>
(SHOUTING) Don't flatter me! 	<br><br>
Why do you wish to be near me? 	<br><br>
Because... 	<br><br>
Because it makes me believe that I, too, can write music. 	<br><br>
Music? 	<br><br>
The vibrations on the air are the breath of God speaking to man's soul. 	<br><br>
Music is the language of God. 	<br><br>
We musicians are as close to God as man can be. 	<br><br>
We hear his voice. 	<br><br>
We read his lips. 	<br><br>
We give birth to the children of God who sing his praise. 	<br><br>
That's what musicians are, Anna Holtz. 	<br><br>
And if we're not that, we're nothing. 	<br><br>
Please, have a seat. 	<br><br>
It's two hours long. 	<br><br>
  MAN: Should be interesting, yes?   Yes. 	<br><br>
  His first symphony in 10 years?   Yes. 	<br><br>
Anna. 	<br><br>
Excuse me, sir. Would you mind? 	<br><br>
Excuse me. 	<br><br>
  I was looking for you in the balconies.   For my Anna, only the best seats. 	<br><br>
How did you get them? 	<br><br>
Well, there are some advantages to having wealthy parents. 	<br><br>
The Archduke. 	<br><br>
Fortunately, we're upwind. 	<br><br>
  You look wonderful.   Thank you. 	<br><br>
Miss Holtz! Miss Holtz! 	<br><br>
You must come with me, please! You must come! 	<br><br>
  (WHISPERING) They're about to start.   It's Beethoven. 	<br><br>
He wanted me to stand in the wings and read time for him. 	<br><br>
Can you imagine standing for two hours? 	<br><br>
I can't stand for two minutes. 	<br><br>
I had to tell him Karl is not here. 	<br><br>
I went to his seat, and he had sold it to an American in a loud suit and a wife half his age. 	<br><br>
You must go to him. He needs you. 	<br><br>
Maestro. 	<br><br>
You sent for me? 	<br><br>
  Karl did not come?   No. 	<br><br>
Perhaps he's ill. 	<br><br>
  That must be it.   He would have, if he could. 	<br><br>
I'm here. 	<br><br>
Everyone thinks I live in silence. 	<br><br>
It's not true. 	<br><br>
My head is constantly filled with sound. It never stops. 	<br><br>
The only relief I have is to write it down. 	<br><br>
God infests my mind with music. 	<br><br>
And then what does he do? He makes me deaf. 	<br><br>
He denies me the pleasure he allows everyone else, hearing my work. 	<br><br>
(BITTERLY) Is that a loving God? 	<br><br>
  Is that a friend?   He is our father. 	<br><br>
My father was a brutal, drunken sod. 	<br><br>
If God is my father, I disown him. 	<br><br>
Maybe... 	<br><br>
Maybe I'm losing my mind. 	<br><br>
That's what they think, all of them. 	<br><br>
What do you think? 	<br><br>
I think God is speaking to you. I know it. 	<br><br>
I can't do this, Anna Holtz. 	<br><br>
  I can't keep the orchestra together.   Maestro, I will help you. 	<br><br>
I will stand where you can see me. 	<br><br>
I'll keep the beat for you, give you the entrances. 	<br><br>
Don't worry. 	<br><br>
Are they here? The vultures? 	<br><br>
Yes. 	<br><br>
The Archduke. 	<br><br>
All the composers. 	<br><br>
All of Vienna. 	<br><br>
My coat, please. 	<br><br>
(ORCHESTRA TUNING) 	<br><br>
  Anna Holtz.   Yes? 	<br><br>
  You look like a woman.   Thank you. 	<br><br>
But can you conduct? 	<br><br>

(AUDIENCE CHEERING) 	<br><br>
Thank you so much. 	<br><br>
Maestro, brilliant! Heavenly! 	<br><br>
  I know.   Divine. 	<br><br>
Anna! Anna Holtz! We did it! We did it! 	<br><br>
Yes. 	<br><br>
We're going to Krenski's tavern. Come celebrate with us. 	<br><br>
I can't, Maestro. The convent. 	<br><br>
Oh, the nuns. Well, bring them along! 	<br><br>
We'll get them drunk and give them a good job! 	<br><br>
Good night. Bravo, Maestro! 	<br><br>

(BEETHOVEN EX CLAIMING) 	<br><br>
For the love of Christ, you filthy bastard! 	<br><br>
What kind of a life can I live down here? 	<br><br>
Anna Holtz. Did you hear it? Coming up the stairs, could you hear it? 	<br><br>
Yes, Maestro. What is it? 	<br><br>
It's the Grosse Fugue. The fugue for the new quartet. 	<br><br>
It's been going round in my head for weeks. 	<br><br>
I've been up all night working on it. 	<br><br>
  What do you think?   May I? 	<br><br>
This is the beginning. 	<br><br>
Well? Well, do you like it? 	<br><br>
  I...   Be frank. I value your frankness. 	<br><br>
I think it's ugly. 	<br><br>
Ugly? You think it's ugly? Of course it's ugly. 	<br><br>
But is it beautiful? 	<br><br>
  I don't understand.   She doesn't understand. 	<br><br>
It's meant to challenge your sense of beauty. 	<br><br>
I'm opening up music to the ugly, to the visceral. 	<br><br>
How else can you get to the divine except through the guts of man? 	<br><br>
See, here. See, this is where God lives. Not in the head. 	<br><br>
Not even in the soul, but in the guts. 	<br><br>
Because this is where the people feel it. 	<br><br>
The intestines twist and coil to heaven. 	<br><br>
Bowels are closer to enlightenment than the brain. 	<br><br>
You can't have your head in the clouds unless there's shit on the soles of your boots. 	<br><br>

(MAN SHOUTING) 	<br><br>
So? So? 	<br><br>
I'm sorry, Maestro. I don't understand it. 	<br><br>
Oh, no. Of course you don't understand. It's not about understanding. 	<br><br>
You must experience these works of mine. 	<br><br>
It's a language, Anna Holtz, a new language I'm inventing to talk about man's experience of God, my experience of God. 	<br><br>
That's why you were sent to me, to write down this language. 	<br><br>
You are God's secretary. 	<br><br>
You read his lips through me, but understanding... 	<br><br>
I have something for you. 	<br><br>
Christ! I'm not even dressed. 	<br><br>
Where did I put it? 	<br><br>
Oh, here, look. 	<br><br>
It's the score I conducted... We conducted from. 	<br><br>
Look. I've inscribed it to you. 	<br><br>

the only hands I can trust to bear it across the tides of time."" "	<br><br>

It's no less than you deserve. 	<br><br>
Maestro, I have something for you. 	<br><br>
What? 	<br><br>
  You wrote it?   Yes. 	<br><br>
It's in C minor, huh? My favorite key. 	<br><br>
This is amazing. I've never seen anything like it. 	<br><br>
It's completely cerebral, isn't it? 	<br><br>
This here... This bit actually shows promise. 	<br><br>

Oh, my God. What have I done? It was the fugue. 	<br><br>
Anna Holtz, I didn't... I didn't think! 	<br><br>
Sometimes I don't think! Ask Karl! 	<br><br>
Anna, please! Let me look at it again! Anna! 	<br><br>
Anna! I'm a fool! I'm an old, stupid, deaf fool! 	<br><br>
You gave me the gift. So, why are you telling me not to use it? 	<br><br>
Why are you doing this to me? 	<br><br>
I didn't ask for this gift. What do you want me to do? 	<br><br>
Anna, your gift is from God. 	<br><br>
Use it to serve him. 	<br><br>
But that's not my calling. 	<br><br>
Music isn't my calling. I came here to study. 	<br><br>
You studied with Salieri. You must know what I mean. 	<br><br>
I didn't even get to meet Salieri. 	<br><br>
They sent me to work with one of his assistants. 	<br><br>
I was 17. He was French. 	<br><br>
I didn't get to sing at the Paris Opera, but I came here. 	<br><br>
And I sing his praises every day, where it is safe. 	<br><br>
And so can you. 	<br><br>
But what'll I say to my father, Aunt Clara? He's sacrificed so much for me. 	<br><br>
It's what your father wants. It's why he sent you. 	<br><br>

  Who do you think you are?   I am Ludwig van Beethoven. 	<br><br>
Sisters, leave now. What do you want? 	<br><br>
You will bring Anna Holtz to me now. 	<br><br>
  Or what will you do?   I command you to bring her to me! 	<br><br>
  Get back to your room.   It's all right, Mother. 	<br><br>
This is for you. 	<br><br>
My composition. 	<br><br>
  What have you done to it?   Made some notes. 	<br><br>
Look, I've even marked the good passages. 	<br><br>
  It's a mess.   But it has promise. 	<br><br>
I told you, it has promise. 	<br><br>
Let me develop it with you. We can work on it together. 	<br><br>
Anna Holtz, forgive me. 	<br><br>
I beg you to forgive me. 	<br><br>
Come back to me. Please. 	<br><br>
Please. 	<br><br>
What? 	<br><br>
I just don't understand it, Maestro. 	<br><br>
  Where does the movement end?   It doesn't end. It flows. 	<br><br>
You have to stop thinking in terms of beginning and ending. 	<br><br>
This is not one of the bridges your iron man builds. 	<br><br>
This is a living thing. 	<br><br>
Like clouds taking shape or tides shifting. 	<br><br>
  But musically, how does it work?   It doesn't work, it grows. 	<br><br>
You see, the first movement becomes the second. 	<br><br>
As each idea dies, a new one's born. 	<br><br>
See, in your work, you're obsessed with structure, with choosing the correct form. 	<br><br>
You have to listen to the voice speaking inside of you. 	<br><br>
I didn't even really hear it myself until I went deaf. 	<br><br>
Not that I want you to go deaf, my dear. 	<br><br>
You're telling me that I must find the silence in myself, 	<br><br>
  so I can hear the music.   Yes. Yes. Yes. 	<br><br>
The silence is the key. The silence between the notes. 	<br><br>
When that silence envelops you, then your soul can sing. 	<br><br>
Anna Holtz, do you know what you mean to me? 	<br><br>
In past years, I've lived in fear because I've been alone, like a man in prison. 	<br><br>
Then God sent you to me. 	<br><br>

  MARTIN: I was so worried.   Maestro, what are you doing? 	<br><br>
BEETHOVEN: I couldn't wait. 	<br><br>
  I only just left.   You may have time. I do not. 	<br><br>
Maestro, this is my friend, Martin Bauer. Martin, Ludwig van Beethoven. 	<br><br>
  A pleasure, sir.   This is your famous bridge? 	<br><br>
Are you going to win? 	<br><br>
  I don't know.   How could you not know that? 	<br><br>
Anna tells me you're an artist. Aren't you an artist? 	<br><br>
Well, that depends on what you mean by an artist. 	<br><br>
An artist is someone who has learned to trust himself. 	<br><br>
Maestro, what do you think? 	<br><br>
  It has no soul.   MARTIN: I beg your pardon? 	<br><br>
It lacks life, grace, passion. It is a dead and worthless thing. 	<br><br>
  You have no right.   Martin... 	<br><br>
No. I don't care who he is. 	<br><br>
I don't care what the world thinks you are. What gives you the right? 	<br><br>
I tell you what gives me the right. 	<br><br>
You build bridges to connect points of land. 	<br><br>
I build them to connect men's souls. God gives me the right. 	<br><br>
God whispers into some men's ears. Well, he shouts into mine! 	<br><br>

  not to be judged, but to judge.   Beethoven... 	<br><br>

But because of the gratitude I bear for Anna, 	<br><br>
I'm going to do you a favor, Martin Bauer. 	<br><br>
  I'm going to give you a gift.   What are you doing? 	<br><br>

Do you want to kill? Start over? Build your bridge from that? 	<br><br>
  MAN: Didn't like that one, Beethoven?   I expect you this evening. 	<br><br>
Make a note of that. Beethoven didn't like that one. 	<br><br>
I didn't like it, either. 	<br><br>
Martin. 	<br><br>
If you ever go near that man again, I'll have nothing more to do with you. 	<br><br>
Do you understand me? 	<br><br>
Nothing. 	<br><br>
How could you do that to him? 	<br><br>
  BEETHOVEN: The fire has gone out.   I'm not your servant. 	<br><br>
I said, I'm not your servant! 	<br><br>
I heard you. 	<br><br>
You've destroyed Martin. 	<br><br>
You talk about God, and then you do this? 	<br><br>
I may have saved his soul, if he has one. 	<br><br>
Has it ever occurred to you that I might love him? 	<br><br>
You don't love him. Not him. 	<br><br>
(SCOFFS) 	<br><br>

No. You want to be me. 	<br><br>

It isn't finished. 	<br><br>
It's good. 	<br><br>
There are a few points to be worked out, but on the whole it's very good. 	<br><br>
It has strength and lyricism. Above all, simplicity. 	<br><br>
There's only one problem. You're copying me, Anna Holtz. 	<br><br>
Is that such a bad thing? 	<br><br>
World doesn't need another Beethoven, but it may need you. 	<br><br>
You may leave if you wish, but that won't free you from me. 	<br><br>
If you work the ending of the fugue, it's finished. 	<br><br>
This is my bridge, Anna Holtz. 	<br><br>
My bridge to the future of music. 	<br><br>
If one day you will cross over it, perhaps you will be free. 	<br><br>

(CLASSICAL MUSIC PLA YING)	<br><br>
	<br><br>
THE MUSIC of BEETHOVEN	<br><br>
The age produces the genius. Certainly this holds true for Beethoven, because in no earlier era could he have asserted his creative ego so defiantly, broken so decisively with the past and struck out in new directions with such independence (Cross & Ewan, p. 54). The late 18th and early 19th century was a time of violent political and social upheaval. This was the time of the French and American Revolutions and the Napoleonic Wars. Power, both political and economic, was shifting from the aristocracy and church to the middle class (Kamien, p. 201). This was the time of such writers and philosophers as Voltaire and Diderot, Rousseau and Goethe and their Age of Enlightenment; the time of Mozart and Haydn and the Classical Age of music.	<br><br>
During this Classical Period of music (1750 1820), structure and convention took precedence over the expressive needs of the artist. (Greenberg, lecture 8). This music was hallmarked by clarity, lightness, brevity, correctness of form and emotional restraint (Cross & Ewan, p. 909). Musicians were supported by the patronage of the court and the nobility. Composers were employed by aristocratic families, wore uniforms, and wrote music for specific individuals or events, not for personal satisfaction or artistic fulfillment. All of this C the purpose of music, its intended audience, the employment of musicians C as well as the form of music itself, changed with Beethoven. 	<br><br>
Ludwig von Beethoven entered the musical world at the height of this Classical period. Born in Bonn, December 16, 1770, Beethoven was forced to practice the piano for hours under the cruel eye of his alcoholic father, a mediocre court musician who was hoping to mold his son into the next Mozart. Beethoven’s talent was recognized and he rose quickly through the ranks to become the Court Organist. In 1787 the Electorate of Cologne financed a trip to Vienna for the 16 year old Beethoven. Unfortunately, Beethoven was in Vienna just a short time before he was called back to Bonn due to the death of his mother, but not before he had an opportunity to meet and play for Mozart, whose alleged response was, “Keep your eyes on him; some day he will give the world something to talk about” (Kamien, p. 256).	<br><br>
Returning to Bonn, he was introduced to Joseph Haydn, considered by his contemporaries to be the greatest composer of the age. After hearing Beethoven’s work, Haydn told Beethoven “You have great talent…you must come to Vienna to study with me,” and in 1792 Beethoven returned to Vienna as Haydn’s student (Cross & Ewan, p. 48). By 1796, the young composer had attracted a large public following as well as a substantial patronage (Landon, pp. 64, 66).	<br><br>
Beethoven had many excellent teachers in Vienna besides Haydn: Albrechtsberger, Schuppanzigh (of string quartet fame) and the famous Salieri, but he was a difficult student. He did, however, earn a reputation as a brilliant concert pianist, and he therefore found himself in great demand in the salons of Vienna’s aristocracy. Vienna’s nobility and citizenry was probably the most musical that ever existed. The city’s prosperity and the generosity of its nobility in regard to musicians, both local and foreign, allowed a level of musicianship unparalleled (Landon, p. 51). Out of a population of 120,000, there were 6000 piano students! (Greenberg, lecture 5). 	<br><br>
During these early years in Vienna, Beethoven wrote prolifically, with his piano sonatas, string quartets and symphonies in particular showing proof of his genius. After mastering the classical techniques of his teachers, Beethoven went on to compose music in new ways. He explored the registral extremes of the piano and discovered new techniques in the workings of its pedals (Encyclopedia, para. 18). He departed from the traditional classical forms more and more by expanding the range of pitch and dynamics; changing the norms of Classical music by repeating rhythmic ideas over and over in order to create momentum; using syncopation and dissonance in order to create tension and excitement; and using very detailed tempo and dynamic markings (Kamien, p. 259). Beethoven employed techniques which were at the time revolutionary, such as the elaboration of a single theme (most notably in the first movement of the Fifth Symphony), the dramatic use of silence (the Coriolanus Overture), and establishing expectations, but then either delaying or ignoring them altogether (as in the Appassionato) (Encyclopedia, para. 21).	<br><br>
Beethoven also made major changes to both the format and length of the symphony, which up to this point had followed very strict rules. During the Classical Period a symphony typically lasted twenty to forty five minutes with a standard form of four movements: (1) a vigorous, fast movement, (2) a slow, lyrical movement, (3) a dance related movement (minuet), and (4) a fast movement (Kamien, p. 216, 259). Beethoven not only considerably lengthened the movements (his Ninth symphony was 65 minutes), but also changed their typical order. He frequently replaced the third movement, the medium tempo minuet, with a rapid paced scherzo (Encyclopedia, para. 21). In combination, all of these seemingly small changes created a mood that was heretofore unheard of. In the words of one critic, starting with the Eroica (Symphony No. 3, Op. 55), “Beethoven’s compositions become to a cardinal degree pointed individuals that one meets and reacts to with the same sort of particularity, intimacy, and concern as one does to another human being.”(International Dictionary, para. 5).	<br><br>
It was during this time that Beethoven entered a period of despair, brought on by both his increasingly serious hearing loss and family problems. While Beethoven had noticed the beginnings of hearing loss as early as the later 1790’s (possibly caused by a bout with typhoid fever in 1787), it was not until 1802 that the problem and his accompanying anguish became public (Greenberg, lecture 6). He wrote, in what is known as the Heiligenstadt Testament: “For me there can be no recreation in the society of my fellows…I must live like an exile.” (Cross & Ewan, p. 51).	<br><br>
For Beethoven, it may have been a period of almost unbearable agony, but for the world it was a gift, for this is when the composer created many of his most beautiful masterpieces: The Appassionato and Moonlight sonatas (Opp. 57, 27/2), the Eroica (Symphony #3, Op. 55), and the Kreutzer Sonata (Op. 47). This creative period continued for several years, culminating in the Symphony #5 in C minor, Op. 67 and the Piano Concerto #5, Op. 73 (commonly known as the Emperor concerto). It was not until 1815 that his hearing loss forced Beethoven to give up public performance altogether. 	<br><br>
Throughout his time of angst, Beethoven never lost sight of the practical side of his composing. This was the time of the emancipation of the composer. When, in 1808, Beethoven began to receive an annual salary from a group of backers, he became one of the first musicians in history to live as an independent artist, free from employment to any one particular household or court (Encyclopedia, para. 10). His financial interests continued to improve.	<br><br>
In 1813, Beethoven was approached by Maelzel (the creator of the metronome) with the idea of writing victory music to celebrate Wellington’s defeat of Napoleon. The timing could not have been more perfect    the Austrians, who had been suffering through the occupation of their precious Vienna, were now, finally, able to experience the thrill of victory and the rebirth of patriotism. When Wellington’s Victory, Op 91 (also known as the Battle Victory or Battle at Vittoria) premiered in December 1813  along with his Seventh Symphony  at a charity concert in aid of wounded soldiers the Austrian audience went wild (Landon, pg 173).	<br><br>
Beethoven’s capitalization on this patriotic fervor continued in September 1814, when the Congress of Vienna convened in Austria to restore order after the Napoleonic Wars. There were leaders from Russia, Great Britain, Austria, Prussia, and France as well as Spain, Portugal, Sweden, and Germany.  Beethoven was now the object of attention and admiration; men of the highest station vied with one another to meet and entertain him (Cross & Ewan, p. 52). He was acclaimed as a national patriotic composer and paid homage by Europe’s political elite (Solomon, p. 51). He was given several commissions during the Congress, among them the cantata Glorious Moment, Op. 136, marking a very lucrative year that included public performances of his opera Fidelio, Op. 72, and Symphonies 7 and 8, Opp. 92, 93 (Greenberg, lecture 2).	<br><br>
However, Beethoven soon found himself falling from popularity. His final public performance as a pianist was in January 1815. Litigation with publishers, loss of patronage, the waning of patriotic fervor, emerging trends in music which Beethoven ignored, the recognition that some of his earlier music was no longer pertinent due to the changing political climate, plus another steep drop in his hearing all led to Beethoven’s decline by 1816 (Greenberg, lecture 3). By 1818 his hearing had digressed to the point that he was forced to communicate through “conversation books,” writing pads in which visitors could converse with Beethoven (Encyclopedia, para. 12). However, as is typical with Beethoven, out of his darkest personal hours came some of his most glorious compositions. 	<br><br>
In what is considered Beethoven’s Third Compositional Period, he wrote the last of his piano sonatas, including the Hammerklavier, Op. 106, the Missa solemnis, Op. 123, his Ninth Symphony, Op. 125, and the final string quartets, including the Grosse Fugue, Op. 133. All of these latter works show a vast expansion of his creativity and complexity, which, while they baffled his contemporaries (and continue to intrigue audiences today), must be viewed as the logical outcome of a lifetime of exploration of tonal structure. Beethoven seemed to sense that his work was well beyond the understanding of his day. It is rumored that his answer to his complex music was that “They are not for you but for a later age” (Encyclopedia, para. 26). 	<br><br>

1824. It is the eve of the premiere of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, and the parts are not ready. Music publisher Wenzel Schlemmer (Ralph Riach) urgently needs a copyist to finish the work, and young Anna Holtz offers one advantage: she is available. While knowing that working with a woman is anathema to the ill and cantankerous Beethoven, Schlemmer has no choice but to hire her. Anna sees it as an opportunity sent from God to show the famous composer her work, and accepts eagerly.	<br><br>
In those times women rarely had careers, so leaving her family and hometown to study composition was a courageous step, says Diane Kruger. "Anna's not afraid to stand up to Beethoven, though she is, naturally, intimidated by his persona." 	<br><br>
In one of their first encounters, learning of Anna's career ambitions, Beethoven tries to overawe the eager student, remarking, "A woman composer is like a dog walking on its hind legs: it's never done well, but you're surprised to see it done at all."	<br><br>
Undeterred, Anna boldly enters his mesmerizing realm, assisting his manic efforts to tap the deepest recesses of his talents. The experience will profoundly change her fate and being.	<br><br>
Beethoven is one of those larger than life characters about whom you can say, ‘Everything you've heard is true'   or at least most of it, explains director Agnieszka Holland. "He changed the very notion of music, destroying rules, conventions   and the nerves of some who worked with him   along the way." 	<br><br>
Bombastic, brilliant, generous, unforgiving, yet kind hearted, Beethoven ruled over the cultural landscape of Europe in the first quarter of the 19th century. Unlike predecessors such as Mozart, Beethoven's reputation was renowned during his lifetime.	<br><br>
Beethoven was really the first freelance musical artist, remarks screenwriter Christopher Wilkinson. "He composed on his own terms, and was not dependent, as was precedent, on salaried positions with the church or a royal family. He believed talent should be valued above bloodlines and titles, a rather radical notion for its time."	<br><br>
A well known quote from musicologist Harold C Shoenberg in Lives of the Great Composers states that while Mozart moved in the periphery of the aristocracy, "Beethoven kicked open the doors, stormed in and made himself at home."	<br><br>
Says Ed Harris, "He is the greatest musician to ever walk the planet. There was a force flowing through him, and he suffered through unimaginable torments in order to write it down the way he experienced it, openly and honestly."	<br><br>
The audience is allowed inside the silent solitude of Beethoven's life through the eyes of Anna Holtz, a fictional character based on actual persons in Beethoven's life or the larger musical realm of Europe.	<br><br>
Comments screenwriter/producer Stephen Rivele, "The great challenge in dramatizing the last years of Beethoven's life is that he really had no one to talk to: his deafness was profound and his relationships were therefore hindered. Anna opens for us the door to his world."	<br><br>
Rivele indicates that two of the real life figures that form the composite for Anna's character were male Austrian music students who worked with Beethoven's long time copyist. Christopher Wilkinson mentions two other inspirations: a female composer living in France, Lorenc Ferenz, who was highly influenced by Beethoven's music, and another woman whose simple act of devotion has become the stuff of lore.	<br><br>
During my earliest research I was struck by the famous story of a woman who entered the stage to turn Beethoven around to face the tumultuous applause at the conclusion of the Ninth Symphony, explains Wilkinson. (Some authors claim the woman to be Caroline Unger, one of the singers). "This gave us the thought of approaching the story from the imagined perspective of someone very close to his heart." 	<br><br>
Beethoven's music draws Anna deeper into the mind of its creator, revealing the whirlwind genius it harbours. Although at heart a gregarious and social being, the composer's worsening deafness and anxieties drive him into increasing isolation. He is scorned by his nephew, Karl (Joe Anderson), whom he describes as "his whole life," and beleaguered by unsettled domestic situations. Reflective of his mood, his music those years is deemed too weighty for the Viennese audiences, who prefer the frivolity of Italian opera.	<br><br>
At the time he is about to debut the 9th, Beethoven has fallen out of favour in Vienna, says the film's music consultant, Piotr Kaminski. "It has been years since his last symphony and audiences are not as interested in instrumental music. Audaciously, he added singers to the symphony, which is both a scandal and a PR magnet. The 9th, which was the first symphony to extend beyond an hour, would mark one of the great comeback stories of all time."	<br><br>
The Viennese were sophisticated, educated and knowledgeable about music, a tough crowd to impress, agrees Christopher Wilkinson. "They were blown away."	<br><br>
After the success of the premiere, with Vienna again at his feet, Beethoven begins writing the late string quartets, a new and perplexing sound that he describes as a bridge to a new form of music altogether. In one of the most revealing scenes in the film, Beethoven explains to Anna that God lives not in men's heads or souls, but in their guts.	<br><br>
His last period is so intense, he went to such deep places, that he damaged his health, says Holland. "From the throes of his most agonizing period came his most difficult and beautiful music. It needs a more sophisticated approach to make it accessible. We're attempting to be faithful to his biography with the plotlines, while utilizing necessary artistic license. Both the tragic and comical resonate in the script, as does his impact on history, the manner in which he changed the notion of genius, and the relationship between composers and society."	<br><br>
Says Ed Harris, "His fortitude was impressive. He was sick, deaf, and terribly lonely, yet he felt he must get this music out of him, and he did until the day he died."	<br><br>
From such abject sorrow such pure beauty. As Beethoven confesses in the film, "Loneliness is my religion."	<br><br>
Exposing new audiences to the composer's late string quartets was one of the driving motivations of Rivele and Wilkinson's screenplay. The duo has been interested in scripting a story of the fabled composer since the early ‘90s, intent on focusing on his final years. (A previous film about Beethoven, "Immortal Beloved," dealt primarily with his love affair with an unknown woman, earlier in his life.)	<br><br>
Rivele says, "The late works are the most sublime and inaccessible of all his music   a language he invented to express the spiritual world he was experiencing at that point in his life. We wanted to create a drama that could help bring this remarkable music to audiences in a way they could fully appreciate."	<br><br>
Although initially unable to fully understand this new musical language, Anna's obsession with Beethoven continues to consume her life, threatening the relationship with her eligible, well to do suitor, Martin Bauer (Matthew Goode).	<br><br>
Architect, engineer, student of science, Martin is apprehensive of Anna's desire to enter a man's world of composing, and is distrustful of Beethoven.	<br><br>
Anna and my character share a mutual spark from the perspective of opposites attracting, but he is very much a man of his time, in a patriarchal society, and wants her to play the traditional role of the wife, says Matthew Goode. "Beethoven refers to him derisively as ‘Ironman,' insinuating he doesn't have a soul. Martin serves as a source of conflict not only between Beethoven and Anna, but between science and art."	<br><br>
On the night of its premiere, Martin can't help but appreciate the stirring exhilaration of the 9th, at the same time realizing that its awesome effect on Anna will begin to pull her further into Beethoven's orbit, and away from his.	<br><br>
Martin sees Anna doing something much different with her life than she does, says Diane Kruger. "Beethoven has intensified her ambitions and desires, and she begins to doubt if she can be with someone who doesn't fully appreciate art and music, not to mention her own desire and talent."	<br><br>
As she begins to turn away from the man she loves, and toward the man she reveres, Anna becomes fully engulfed in Beethoven's aura. She becomes muse and witness to a profound struggle between mortality and an indomitable human will, an epic confrontation whose musical expression has rung in ears, hearts and souls ever since.	<br><br>
This story is a testament of hope and inspiration rising from turmoil, says Stephen Rivele. "Having once mocked her ambitions, Beethoven asks Anna to help him with the last string quartets   his legacy to the future of music. She learns the deepest meaning of music, and finds the strength to become an artist of her own making."	<br><br>
