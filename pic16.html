Michael Jackson <br><br>
We Are The World<br><br>
"We Are the World" is a song and charity single originally recorded by the supergroup USA for Africa in 1985. It was written by Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie, and produced by Quincy Jones and Michael Omartian for the album We Are the World. With sales in excess of 20 million copies, it is one of the fewer than 30 all-time singles to have sold at least 10 million copies worldwide.<br><br>

There comes a time when we hear a certain call<br><br>
 When the world must come together as one<br><br>
 There are people dying<br><br>
 And its time to lend a hand to life<br><br>
 The greatest gift of all<br><br>

We can't go on pretending day by day<br><br>
 That someone, somewhere will soon make a change<br><br>
 We are all a part of God's great big family<br><br>
 And the truth, you know,<br><br>
 Love is all we need<br><br>

[Chorus]<br><br>
 We are the world, we are the children<br><br>
 We are the ones who make a brighter day<br><br>
 So lets start giving<br><br>
 There's a choice we're making<br><br>
 We're saving our own lives<br><br>
 Its true we'll make a better day<br><br>
 Just you and me<br><br>

Send them your heart so they'll know that someone cares<br><br>
 And their lives will be stronger and free<br><br>
 As God has shown us by turning stones to bread<br><br>
 So we all must lend a helping hand<br><br>

[Chorus]<br><br>

When you're down and out, there seems no hope at all<br><br>
 But if you just believe there's no way we can fall<br><br>
 Let us realize that a change can only come<br><br>
 When we stand together as one<br><br>
